    'Content for Unit 9, Lesson 2 (pH & Indicators) is pending. This lesson will introduce the pH scale as a measure of acidity/basicity. Students will learn to calculate pH and pOH from hydrogen ion [H⁺] or hydroxide ion [OH⁻] concentrations. The concept of Kw (ion product constant for water) will be discussed. The use of acid-base indicators to estimate pH will also be covered.',
