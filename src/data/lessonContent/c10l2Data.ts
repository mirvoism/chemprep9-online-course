    'Content for Unit 10, Lesson 2 (Voltaic & Electrolytic Cells) is pending. This lesson will delve deeper into electrochemical cells, comparing and contrasting voltaic (galvanic) cells, which produce electricity from spontaneous redox reactions, and electrolytic cells, which use electricity to drive non-spontaneous redox reactions. Key components (anode, cathode, salt bridge/electrolyte) and the direction of electron and ion flow will be emphasized. Applications such as batteries and electroplating will be discussed.',
