    "Content for Unit 8, Lesson 3 (Equilibrium & Le Chatelier's Principle) is pending. This lesson will define dynamic chemical equilibrium and introduce the concept of the equilibrium constant (Keq). Le Chatelier's Principle will be explained and applied to predict how changes in concentration, temperature, and pressure affect systems at equilibrium.",
