    "Content for Unit 5, Lesson 3 (Empirical & Molecular Formulas) is pending. This lesson will teach students how to determine the empirical formula of a compound from percent composition data or mass data of its constituent elements. The relationship between empirical formula and molecular formula will be explored, including how to determine the molecular formula given the empirical formula and the compound's molar mass.",
