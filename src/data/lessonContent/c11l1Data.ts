    'Content for Unit 11, Lesson 1 (Introduction to Organic Chemistry) is pending. This lesson will define organic chemistry as the study of carbon-containing compounds. The unique bonding capabilities of carbon (tetravalency, ability to form chains, rings, multiple bonds) will be highlighted. Basic nomenclature for simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes) and an introduction to common functional groups will be covered.',
