    'Content for Unit 10, Lesson 3 (Activity Series & Spontaneity) is pending. This lesson will focus on using the Activity Series of Metals (often provided as a reference table like NYS Table J) to predict whether a single replacement redox reaction will occur spontaneously. The concept of standard reduction potentials and their use in calculating standard cell potential (E°cell) to determine spontaneity will also be introduced.',
