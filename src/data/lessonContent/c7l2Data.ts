    'Content for Unit 7, Lesson 2 (Heat & Thermochemistry) is pending. This lesson will differentiate between heat (energy transfer) and temperature (average kinetic energy). The specific heat capacity concept and the formula q=mcΔT will be used for calorimetry calculations. Enthalpy changes (ΔH) for chemical reactions, distinguishing between endothermic and exothermic processes, will be introduced (linking to potential energy diagrams).',
