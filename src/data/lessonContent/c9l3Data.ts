    'Content for Unit 9, Lesson 3 (Titration & Neutralization) is pending. This lesson will explain the process of acid-base titration, including the role of indicators and the concept of the equivalence point. Students will learn to perform titration calculations, particularly for strong acid-strong base titrations (e.g., using MaVa = MbVb for 1:1 mole ratios). Writing and balancing neutralization reactions will also be covered.',
