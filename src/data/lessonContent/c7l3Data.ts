    'Content for Unit 7, Lesson 3 (Colligative Properties) is pending. This lesson will define colligative properties as properties of solutions that depend on the concentration of solute particles, not their identity. Key colligative properties to be discussed include vapor pressure lowering, freezing point depression, and boiling point elevation, along with qualitative explanations.',
