## 🚀 Major Fixes Applied

### **Critical Issue Resolution**
**Problem**: Units 11 and 12 displayed raw markdown instead of rendered HTML
**Root Cause**: Backticks around chemical equations and improper citation format
**Solution Applied**: 
1. Removed all backticks from chemical equations and code blocks
2. Changed citation format from numbered to reference-key style
3. Used proper markdown formatting without extra encoding

### **Technical Changes Made**:

**Unit 11 (Organic Chemistry)**:
- ✅ Removed backticks: `` `CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl` `` → `CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl`
- ✅ Fixed citation format: `${citationInline('1')}` → `${citationInline('organic-chemistry-overview', 1)}`
- ✅ Corrected markdown tables and headers
- ✅ Created backup: `c11l1Enhanced.ts.backup-20250610-xxxxx`

**Unit 12 (Nuclear Chemistry)**:
- ✅ Removed backticks: `` `²³⁸₉₂U → ⁴₂He + ²³⁴₉₀Th` `` → `²³⁸₉₂U → ⁴₂He + ²³⁴₉₀Th`
- ✅ Fixed citation format: `${citationInline('1')}` → `${citationInline('nuclear-chemistry-overview', 1)}`
- ✅ Corrected nuclear equation formatting
- ✅ Created backup: `c12l1Enhanced.ts.backup-20250610-xxxxx`

### **Verification Results**:
Both units now display:
- ✅ Proper HTML headers (no raw markdown)
- ✅ Clean chemical/nuclear equations (no backticks)
- ✅ Formatted tables
- ✅ Working citation system with reference keys
- ✅ Professional presentation matching other working units

## 🔄 Next Session Priorities

### **IMMEDIATE TESTING NEEDED**
1. **🔍 Test Units 7, 8, 9**: Remaining recently fixed priority units
2. **✅ Complete systematic validation**: Units 3, 4, 5, 10
3. **🔧 Minor fixes**: Unit 1 SVG 3 water molecule sizing

### **Testing Strategy for Next Session**
1. **Priority 1**: Test recently fixed units 7, 8, 9 (expect them to work now based on fixes)
2. **Priority 2**: Test remaining baseline units 3, 4, 5, 10
3. **Priority 3**: Complete minor SVG fix for Unit 1
4. **Priority 4**: Final comprehensive validation of all 12 units

## ✅ Verified Working Elements

### **Excellent Foundation Systems**
- **Homepage**: Modern 2025 design, all 12 units accessible
- **Navigation**: Robust across all tested units
- **Citation Systems**: Two styles working (inline + reference-key)
- **Progress Tracking**: Functional across all units
- **Content Processing**: Now working correctly for recently fixed units
- **No JavaScript Errors**: Stable underlying system

### **Gold Standard Units** (Perfect Functionality)
- **Unit 2: Atomic Structure** - Comprehensive content, flawless rendering
- **Unit 6: Physical Behavior of Matter** - Recently fixed, working perfectly
- **Unit 11: Organic Chemistry** - Fixed in this session, now perfect
- **Unit 12: Nuclear Chemistry** - Fixed in this session, now perfect

## 💡 Key Insights Discovered

1. **Root Cause Identified**: The issue was not with the content processing pipeline itself, but with improper markdown formatting (backticks) in specific unit files
2. **Inconsistent Fixes**: The recent fixes were applied inconsistently - some units (6) were fixed properly, others (11, 12) retained problematic formatting
3. **Citation Systems**: Two citation styles work (numbered inline + reference-key), providing flexibility
4. **Backup Strategy**: Critical to create backups before any content modifications
