## üóìÔ∏è AUDIT HISTORY

### **AUDIT v1.0** - June 6, 2025 (Initial Beta App Analysis)

#### **Overall Score: 3.7/5** üü° Excellent Foundation - Minor Revisions Needed

| Dimension | Score | Rationale | Priority |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Factual Accuracy** | 4/5 | Strong chemistry content with proper formulas, equations, and scientific concepts. SVG diagrams accurately represent molecular structures. Minor oversimplifications appropriate for grade level. | Medium |
| **Citation Integrity** | 2/5 | **CRITICAL ISSUE**: No citations or references to authoritative sources. PhET simulations properly attributed, but no textbook or scientific source citations found. | **HIGH** |
| **Curriculum Alignment** | 4/5 | Excellent alignment with NYSED Physical Setting/Chemistry standards. Unit progression follows logical sequence. Content depth appropriate for 9th grade honors level. | Medium |
| **Pedagogical Clarity** | 5/5 | Outstanding age-appropriate explanations with scaffolded learning. Rich visual diagrams, clear objectives, real-world connections. Progressive difficulty with good use of analogies. | Low |
| **Assessment Quality** | 3/5 | Basic question-answer format with detailed explanations. Lacks variety in question types, no formative assessments, limited Regents-style practice. Progress tracking is binary (complete/incomplete). | **HIGH** |
| **Completeness & Depth** | 4/5 | Comprehensive coverage of all major chemistry topics. Good depth for introductory level. Interactive elements enhance understanding. Could use more lab simulations and advanced problem sets. | Medium |
