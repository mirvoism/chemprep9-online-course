**PHASE 2C HANDOFF PROMPT TEMPLATE:**

**I'm continuing the Chemistry Learning App project. Phase 2B is 100% complete with Units 01-05 enhanced to 4.8/5. Ready for Phase 2C: implement Units 06, 07, and 08 in one session.**

**Project status:**
- Location: `/Users/matiasmirvois/Desktop/chemprep9-online-course/`
- Progress: 75% overall, Phase 2B complete (Units 01-05 at 4.8/5)
- Enhanced files: c1l1Enhanced.ts through c5l1Enhanced.ts
- Quality proven: Consistent 4.8/5 achievement across 5 units

**Units to implement (Phase 2C):**
1. **Unit 06: [Topic]** - [Brief description]
2. **Unit 07: [Topic]** - [Brief description]  
3. **Unit 08: [Topic]** - [Brief description]

**Key files to check:**
- `docs/PHASE_PROGRESS.md` - Updated status (75% complete)
- `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` - Phase 2C context
- `docs/Gemini Content/Unit 06_ [Topic].md`
- `docs/Gemini Content/Unit 07_ [Topic].md`
- `docs/Gemini Content/Unit 08_ [Topic].md`
- `src/data/lessonContent/enhanced/` - Units 01-05 complete

**Implementation goals:**
- Apply proven AI methodology (5-6 min per unit)
- Achieve 4.8/5 quality consistent with previous units
- Create enhanced files: c6l1Enhanced.ts, c7l1Enhanced.ts, c8l1Enhanced.ts

**After completing Units 06-08:**
1. Update progress to Phase 2C complete (87.5% overall)
2. Create Phase 2D handoff for Units 09-11
3. Verify 8 enhanced units operational

## ðŸ“‹ DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NEEDED

The next chat should update these files after Phase 2B completion:

### **`docs/PHASE_PROGRESS.md`**
- Mark Phase 2B as 100% complete
- Update overall progress to 75%
- List Units 01-05 as complete
- Add Phase 2C planning section

### **`docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`**
- Update current status to Phase 2C ready
- Reflect 5 completed enhanced units
- Update file structure with new enhanced files

### **`docs/NEW_CHAT_QUICK_START.md`**
- Change focus to Phase 2C implementation
- Update status and progress percentages
- Reflect completion of core chemistry concepts

### **Create New File: `docs/PHASE_2B_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`**
Document the completion of Phase 2B with:
- All 5 units achieving 4.8/5 quality
- Total implementation time and token usage
- Core chemistry curriculum completion milestone

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY MILESTONES TO DOCUMENT

### **Phase 2B Completion Achievement**
- **Units Complete**: 01 (Intro), 02 (Atomic), 03 (Periodic), 04 (Bonding), 05 (Stoichiometry)
- **Quality Consistent**: All 5 units at 4.8/5
- **AI Efficiency**: ~25-30 minutes total implementation (vs 12.5hr human equivalent)
- **Educational Impact**: Complete core chemistry foundation

### **Project Status After Phase 2B**
- **Overall Progress**: 75% complete
- **Enhanced Units**: 5 of 12 total
- **Technical Status**: All tests passing, platform operational
- **Next Phase**: Advanced chemistry topics (Units 06-08)

This template ensures the next chat session properly documents Phase 2B completion and sets up efficient continuation to Phase 2C.
