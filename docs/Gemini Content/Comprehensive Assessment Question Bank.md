   (Answer: C)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U1) Explain the difference between an element and a compound at the atomic level.  
(Answer: An element is made of only one type of atom (e.g., all atoms are copper). A compound is made of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio (e.g., H₂O molecules, each containing 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom).)

6. (U1) A student measures the boiling point of water to be 98.6 °C. The accepted boiling point is 100.0 °C. Calculate the student's percent error.  
   (Answer: Percent Error \= (|98.6 \- 100.0| / 100.0) \* 100% \= (1.4 / 100.0) \* 100% \= 1.4%)  
7. (U1) Classify each of the following as a physical change or a chemical change: (a) melting an ice cube, (b) burning a piece of paper, (c) dissolving sugar in water.  
   (Answer: (a) Physical change, (b) Chemical change, (c) Physical change.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U1) A rectangular block of wood has dimensions of 2.0 cm, 5.5 cm, and 10.0 cm. It has a mass of 82.5 g.  
(a) Calculate the volume of the block.  
(b) Calculate the density of the block. Remember to use the correct number of significant figures in your final answers.  
(Answer:  
(a) Volume \= 2.0 cm \* 5.5 cm \* 10.0 cm \= 110 cm³. (2 sig figs from 2.0)  
(b) Density \= mass/volume \= 82.5 g / 110 cm³ \= 0.75 g/cm³. (2 sig figs)  
)

9. (U1) Using dimensional analysis, convert a speed of 90.0 kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s).  
   (Answer: (90.0 km/hr) \* (1000 m/1 km) \* (1 hr/60 min) \* (1 min/60 s) \= 25.0 m/s)

Application:  
10\. (U1) You are given a mixture of small plastic beads and sand. Describe a step-by-step procedure you could use to separate these two substances, explaining the physical property that allows the separation to work.  
(Answer: Add the mixture to a beaker of water. The sand will sink because its density is greater than water, while the plastic beads will float because their density is less than water. The beads can then be skimmed off the surface. This separation works because of the difference in density between the three substances.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U1) The density of gold is 19.3 g/cm³. A person claiming to have a pure gold nugget says it has a mass of 95.0 g and a volume of 5.5 cm³. Is the nugget likely pure gold? Justify your answer with a calculation.  
(Answer: Calculate the density of the nugget: Density \= 95.0 g / 5.5 cm³ ≈ 17.3 g/cm³. This calculated density is significantly lower than the accepted density of gold (19.3 g/cm³). Therefore, the nugget is not likely pure gold.)

### **Unit 02: Atomic Structure**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U2) Rutherford's gold foil experiment provided evidence that an atom:  
   (A) is a hard, indivisible sphere.  
   (B) consists of a positively charged "pudding" with electrons embedded in it.  
   (C) has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.  
   (D) has electrons in fixed planetary orbits.  
   (Answer: C)  
2. (U2) What is the total number of neutrons in an atom of ¹⁹₉F?  
   (A) 9  
   (B) 10  
   (C) 19  
   (D) 28  
   (Answer: B. Neutrons \= Mass Number \- Atomic Number \= 19 \- 9 \= 10\)  
3. (U2) Which model of the atom was the first to include a nucleus?  
   (A) Dalton's model  
   (B) Thomson's model  
   (C) Rutherford's model  
   (D) Bohr's model  
   (Answer: C)  
4. (U2) The bright-line spectrum of an element is produced when electrons:  
   (A) move from lower to higher energy levels.  
   (B) move from higher to lower energy levels.  
   (C) are lost from the atom.  
   (D) are gained by the atom.  
   (Answer: B)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U2) An atom has an electron configuration of 2-8-5. Identify the element and state the number of valence electrons it has.  
(Answer: The total number of electrons is 2+8+5 \= 15\. The element with atomic number 15 is Phosphorus (P). It has 5 valence electrons (the electrons in the outermost shell).)

6. (U2) Explain, in terms of subatomic particles, why atoms of Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are both considered isotopes of carbon.  
   (Answer: They are isotopes because they both have the same number of protons (6 protons), which makes them carbon. However, they have different numbers of neutrons (C-12 has 6 neutrons, C-14 has 8 neutrons), giving them different mass numbers.)  
7. (U2) A neutral magnesium atom (Mg) has an atomic number of 12 and a mass number of 24\. It loses two electrons. What is the resulting particle called, and what is its net charge?  
   (Answer: The resulting particle is a magnesium ion (or cation). Since it lost two negative electrons, its net charge is \+2.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U2) Element X has two natural isotopes. The isotope X-63 has a mass of 62.93 amu and a relative abundance of 69.17%. The isotope X-65 has a mass of 64.93 amu and a relative abundance of 30.83%. Calculate the average atomic mass of element X.  
(Answer:  
Contribution from X-63 \= 62.93 amu \* 0.6917 \= 43.529 amu  
Contribution from X-65 \= 64.93 amu \* 0.3083 \= 20.017 amu  
Average Atomic Mass \= 43.529 \+ 20.017 \= 63.546 amu. (This element is Copper, Cu))

9. (U2) An atom of potassium-40 contains 19 protons, 21 neutrons, and 19 electrons. Write the isotopic notation for this atom in the form of ᴬzX.  
   (Answer: ⁴⁰₁₉K)

Application:  
10\. (U2) When a specific salt is heated in a flame, a vibrant green light is produced. Explain this phenomenon in terms of electron behavior, using the terms "ground state," "excited state," and "energy."  
(Answer: The atoms in the salt absorb energy from the flame. This causes their electrons to jump from their normal, low-energy 'ground state' to a higher-energy 'excited state.' This state is unstable, so the electrons immediately fall back down to the ground state. As they fall, they release the absorbed energy as light. The green color corresponds to the specific amount of energy released during this transition.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U2) The nucleus of a particular atom is sometimes called a "nuclide." A certain nuclide contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons. It undergoes a process where it emits an alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus, ⁴₂He). What is the atomic number and mass number of the new nuclide that is formed? Identify the new element.  
(Answer: The original nuclide is Uranium-235 (²³⁵₉₂U). Emitting an alpha particle (2 protons, 2 neutrons) reduces the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4\.  
New Atomic Number \= 92 \- 2 \= 90  
New Mass Number \= 235 \- 4 \= 231  
The element with atomic number 90 is Thorium (Th). The new nuclide is Thorium-231 (²³¹₉₀Th).)

### **Unit 03: The Periodic Table**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U3) Elements in the same period of the periodic table have the same:  
   (A) number of valence electrons.  
   (B) atomic radius.  
   (C) chemical properties.  
   (D) number of occupied electron shells.  
   (Answer: D)  
2. (U3) Which element has the highest electronegativity?  
   (A) Fluorine (F)  
   (B) Lithium (Li)  
   (C) Francium (Fr)  
   (D) Helium (He)  
   (Answer: A)  
3. (U3) Which of the following elements is classified as a metalloid?  
   (A) Sulfur (S)  
   (B) Silicon (Si)  
   (C) Silver (Ag)  
   (D) Sodium (Na)  
   (Answer: B)  
4. (U3) The elements in Group 2 are known as the:  
   (A) Alkali metals  
   (B) Halogens  
   (C) Noble gases  
   (D) Alkaline earth metals  
   (Answer: D)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U3) Explain why a sodium atom (Na) is larger than a chlorine atom (Cl), even though chlorine has more electrons and protons.  
(Answer: Both sodium and chlorine are in Period 3, meaning they have the same number of electron shells. As you move from sodium to chlorine across the period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases. This stronger positive nuclear charge pulls the electron cloud in more tightly, making the chlorine atom smaller than the sodium atom.)

6. (U3) A calcium atom forms a Ca²⁺ ion. Does the ion have a larger or smaller radius than the original atom? Explain why.  
   (Answer: The Ca²⁺ ion is smaller than the Ca atom. The neutral calcium atom loses its two outermost valence electrons to become the ion. This results in the loss of its entire outer electron shell, making the resulting ion significantly smaller.)  
7. (U3) Why do elements in Group 17 (the Halogens) have similar chemical properties?  
   (Answer: Elements in Group 17 have similar chemical properties because they all have the same number of valence electrons (7). This gives them a strong tendency to gain one electron to achieve a stable octet, making them all highly reactive nonmetals.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U3) Consider the elements: Mg, Si, S, and Ba.  
(a) Arrange them in order of increasing atomic radius.  
(b) Arrange them in order of increasing first ionization energy.  
(Answer:  
(a) S \< Si \< Mg \< Ba. (Radius decreases across period 3, and Ba is much larger in period 6).  
(b) Ba \< Mg \< Si \< S. (IE increases across period 3, and Ba has a much lower IE in period 6). )  
Application:  
9\. (U3) An unknown element is a brittle solid that is a poor conductor of electricity. It is located in Group 16\. Predict the charge of the ion this element is most likely to form and whether it would have a high or low electronegativity.  
(Answer: As a brittle solid and poor conductor, it is a nonmetal. Elements in Group 16 have 6 valence electrons. To achieve a stable octet, it will most likely gain 2 electrons, forming an ion with a \-2 charge. As a nonmetal on the right side of the table, it would have a relatively high electronegativity.)

10. (U3) Element 119 has not yet been discovered, but its position on the periodic table can be predicted. In which group and period would you expect to find it? What known element would it have properties most similar to?  
    (Answer: Element 118 (Oganesson) completes Period 7\. Element 119 would start Period 8 and be in Group 1\. It would have properties most similar to the other alkali metals, especially Francium (Fr), the element directly above it.)

Extension:  
11\. (U3) The first ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJ/mol, but the second ionization energy (the energy to remove a second electron) is 4562 kJ/mol, nearly ten times higher. Using your knowledge of electron configuration, explain this huge jump in energy.  
(Answer: Sodium's electron configuration is 2-8-1. The first ionization energy removes the single valence electron from the third shell. This is relatively easy. To remove a second electron, you must break into the now-full, stable second shell (octet). This requires a massive amount of energy because the electron is being removed from a stable, noble-gas-like configuration and is much closer to the nucleus.)

### **Unit 04: Chemical Bonding**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U4) Which type of bond is formed when electrons are transferred from a metal atom to a nonmetal atom?  
   (A) Ionic bond  
   (B) Polar covalent bond  
   (C) Nonpolar covalent bond  
   (D) Metallic bond  
   (Answer: A)  
2. (U4) A molecule of ammonia (NH₃) has a pyramidal shape. Which statement best describes this molecule?  
   (A) It is symmetrical and therefore nonpolar.  
   (B) It is symmetrical and therefore polar.  
   (C) It is asymmetrical and therefore nonpolar.  
   (D) It is asymmetrical and therefore polar.  
   (Answer: D)  
3. (U4) Which substance would have the highest melting point due to its strong network covalent bonds?  
   (A) Water (H₂O)  
   (B) Methane (CH₄)  
   (C) Diamond (C)  
   (D) Sodium Chloride (NaCl)  
   (Answer: C)  
4. (U4) The ability of a substance to be hammered into sheets is called:  
   (A) Ductility  
   (B) Conductivity  
   (C) Lustre  
   (D) Malleability  
   (Answer: D)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U4) Draw the Lewis dot structure for a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂).  
(Answer: O=C=O, with two lone pairs of electrons on each oxygen atom. The structure should show two double bonds between the carbon and each oxygen.)

6. (U4) Explain why metals are excellent conductors of electricity.  
   (Answer: Metals have a "sea" of mobile, delocalized valence electrons that are not bound to any single atom. These electrons are free to move throughout the metal structure and can carry an electric current.)  
7. (U4) Identify the strongest type of intermolecular force present in a sample of liquid ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).  
   (Answer: Hydrogen bonding. This is because ethanol contains a hydrogen atom bonded directly to an oxygen atom.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U4) Based on electronegativity differences, classify the bond in each of the following compounds as ionic, polar covalent, or nonpolar covalent:  
(a) K-Cl (EN: K=0.8, Cl=3.2)  
(b) O-H (EN: O=3.4, H=2.2)  
(c) N-N (EN: N=3.0)  
(Answer:  
(a) ΔEN \= 3.2 \- 0.8 \= 2.4. This large difference indicates an ionic bond.  
(b) ΔEN \= 3.4 \- 2.2 \= 1.2. This indicates a polar covalent bond.  
(c) ΔEN \= 3.0 \- 3.0 \= 0\. This indicates a nonpolar covalent bond.)  
Application:  
9\. (U4) Water (H₂O) and methane (CH₄) have similar molar masses. However, water is a liquid at room temperature while methane is a gas. Explain this difference in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: Water is a polar molecule capable of strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. Methane is a nonpolar molecule and only has weak London dispersion forces between its molecules. The strong hydrogen bonds in water require much more energy to overcome, resulting in a much higher boiling point, making it a liquid at room temperature.)

10. (U4) A student tests two white crystalline solids. Solid A dissolves in water to form a solution that conducts electricity. Solid B dissolves in water, but the solution does not conduct electricity. What type of bonding is likely present in Solid A and Solid B?  
    (Answer: Solid A likely has ionic bonding, as it dissociates into mobile ions in water that can conduct electricity. Solid B likely has polar covalent bonding, as it dissolves in water ("like dissolves like") but does not form ions.)

Extension:  
11\. (U4) Graphite and diamond are both allotropes (different forms) of pure carbon. Diamond is extremely hard and an electrical insulator, while graphite is soft, slippery, and an electrical conductor. Explain these different properties in terms of their bonding structures.  
(Answer: In diamond, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a strong, rigid, three-dimensional tetrahedral network. This makes it extremely hard, and the electrons are locked in bonds, so it doesn't conduct electricity. In graphite, carbon atoms are bonded in flat, two-dimensional hexagonal sheets. The bonds within the sheets are strong, but the sheets are held together by weak intermolecular forces, allowing them to slide past each other, making graphite soft and slippery. Graphite also has delocalized electrons within the sheets that are free to move, allowing it to conduct electricity.)

### **Unit 05: Chemical Reactions & Stoichiometry**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U5) Given the unbalanced equation: \_Fe \+ \_Cl₂ → \_FeCl₃. When the equation is correctly balanced using the smallest whole-number coefficients, the coefficient for Cl₂ is:  
   (A) 1  
   (B) 2

   (A) 29 g/mol  
   (B) 57 g/mol  
   (C) 58 g/mol  
   (D) 74 g/mol  
   (Answer: D. Ca=40.08, O=16.00, H=1.01. Mass \= 40.08 \+ 2(16.00 \+ 1.01) \= 74.10 g/mol\*)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U5) What is the mass in grams of 2.50 moles of carbon dioxide (CO₂)?  
(Answer: Molar mass of CO₂ \= 12.01 \+ 2(16.00) \= 44.01 g/mol. Mass \= 2.50 mol × 44.01 g/mol \= 110\. g)

6. (U5) A compound has an empirical formula of CH₂ and a molar mass of 56 g/mol. What is its molecular formula?  
   (Answer: Mass of empirical formula (CH₂) \= 12.01 \+ 2(1.01) \= 14.03 g/mol. Multiplier \= (Molar Mass / Empirical Mass) \= 56 / 14.03 ≈ 4\. The molecular formula is 4 × (CH₂) \= C₄H₈.)  
7. (U5) Why must a chemical equation be balanced? Which scientific law does this satisfy?  
   (Answer: A chemical equation must be balanced to show that atoms are conserved during the reaction. This satisfies the Law of Conservation of Mass.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U5) Given the reaction: N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g). If 5.0 grams of N₂ react completely with excess H₂, how many grams of NH₃ will be produced?  
(Answer:  
Moles N₂ \= 5.0 g / 28.02 g/mol \= 0.178 mol N₂.  
Moles NH₃ \= 0.178 mol N₂ × (2 mol NH₃ / 1 mol N₂) \= 0.356 mol NH₃.  
Mass NH₃ \= 0.356 mol NH₃ × 17.04 g/mol \= 6.1 g NH₃.)

9. (U5) Calculate the percent composition by mass of oxygen in magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO₃)₂.  
   (Answer: Molar mass Mg(NO₃)₂ \= 24.31 \+ 2(14.01 \+ 316.00) \= 148.33 g/mol. Mass of oxygen \= 6 \* 16.00 \= 96.00 g/mol. %O \= (96.00 / 148.33) \* 100% \= 64.7%)

Application:  
10\. (U5) In a lab, a student decomposes 10.0 g of sodium bicarbonate, 2NaHCO₃ → Na₂CO₃ \+ H₂O \+ CO₂. The theoretical yield of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is 6.31 g. The student actually collects 5.85 g. What is the percent yield of the experiment?  
(Answer: Percent Yield \= (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100% \= (5.85 g / 6.31 g) × 100% \= 92.7%)  
Extension:  
11\. (U5) The reaction for making aspirin is: C₇H₆O₃ \+ C₄H₆O₃ → C₉H₈O₄ \+ HC₂H₃O₂. If a chemist starts with 14.0 grams of C₇H₆O₃ (salicylic acid, M=138.12 g/mol) and 20.0 grams of C₄H₆O₃ (acetic anhydride, M=102.09 g/mol), which one is the limiting reactant?  
(Answer: Moles C₇H₆O₃ \= 14.0g / 138.12g/mol \= 0.101 mol. Moles C₄H₆O₃ \= 20.0g / 102.09g/mol \= 0.196 mol. The reaction is a 1:1 ratio. Since there are fewer moles of salicylic acid (0.101 mol) than acetic anhydride (0.196 mol), the salicylic acid (C₇H₆O₃) is the limiting reactant.)

### **Unit 06: Physical Behavior of Matter**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U6) Which statement correctly describes the particles of a gas according to the Kinetic Molecular Theory?  
   (A) They are strongly attracted to each other and are in fixed positions.  
   (B) They are in constant, random, straight-line motion.  
   (C) They have a definite volume but no definite shape.  
   (D) They have strong intermolecular forces and move slowly.  
   (Answer: B)  
2. (U6) A sample of gas is in a sealed, rigid container. If the temperature of the gas is increased, the pressure inside the container will:  
   (A) increase.  
   (B) decrease.  
   (C) remain the same.  
   (Answer: A)  
3. (U6) The phase change from a solid directly to a gas is called:  
   (A) Melting  
   (B) Condensation  
   (C) Sublimation  
   (D) Deposition  
   (Answer: C)  
4. (U6) Under which conditions of temperature and pressure does a real gas behave most like an ideal gas?  
   (A) low temperature and low pressure  
   (B) low temperature and high pressure  
   (C) high temperature and low pressure  
   (D) high temperature and high pressure  
   (Answer: C)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U6) Explain why the temperature of water remains constant at 100°C while it is boiling, even though heat is continuously being added.  
(Answer: During a phase change like boiling, the added heat energy (potential energy) is used to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the liquid molecules together, rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature) of the molecules. Once all the liquid has turned to gas, the temperature of the gas can then increase.)

6. (U6) Explain the relationship between the volatility of a liquid and the strength of its intermolecular forces.  
   (Answer: Volatility is the tendency of a liquid to evaporate. Liquids with weak intermolecular forces are more volatile because their molecules can easily escape into the gas phase. Liquids with strong intermolecular forces are less volatile.)

Problem Solving:  
7\. (U6) A balloon contains 1.5 L of air at 25 °C. If the balloon is placed in a freezer where the temperature is \-10 °C, what will the new volume of the balloon be (assuming constant pressure)?  
(Answer: First, convert temperatures to Kelvin: T₁ \= 25 \+ 273 \= 298 K; T₂ \= \-10 \+ 273 \= 263 K. Use Charles's Law: V₁/T₁ \= V₂/T₂. (1.5 L / 298 K) \= V₂ / 263 K. V₂ \= (1.5 L × 263 K) / 298 K \= 1.3 L.)

8. (U6) A gas in a rigid 2.0 L container is at a pressure of 1.0 atm and a temperature of 300 K. If the pressure is increased to 2.5 atm, what is the new temperature in Kelvin?  
   (Answer: Use Gay-Lussac's Law: P₁/T₁ \= P₂/T₂. (1.0 atm / 300 K) \= (2.5 atm / T₂). T₂ \= (2.5 atm \* 300 K) / 1.0 atm \= 750 K.)

Application:  
9\. (U6) A can of spray paint has a warning label that says, "Do not store above 120 °F (49 °C). Do not incinerate." Use the gas laws to explain the danger of heating the can.  
(Answer: A spray can has a fixed volume. According to Gay-Lussac's Law, at constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. Heating the can increases the temperature of the gas inside, which causes a drastic increase in pressure. This can cause the can to explode.)

10. (U6) Explain why cooking food at a high altitude (where atmospheric pressure is lower) often takes longer than at sea level.  
    (Answer: At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower. The boiling point of water is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, water boils at a lower temperature at high altitudes. Since the food is cooking in water that is not as hot, it takes longer for the chemical reactions of cooking to complete.)

Extension:  
11\. (U6) The normal boiling point of ethanol is 78 °C, and the normal boiling point of water is 100 °C. Which substance has the higher vapor pressure at 78 °C? Explain your answer in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: At 78 °C, ethanol has the higher vapor pressure. The boiling point is when vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. Since ethanol boils at 78 °C, its vapor pressure must be 1 atm at that temperature. Water, which doesn't boil until 100 °C, will have a vapor pressure lower than 1 atm at 78 °C. This is because water has stronger intermolecular forces (specifically, stronger hydrogen bonding) than ethanol, making it less volatile and giving it a lower vapor pressure at any given temperature below its boiling point.)

### **Unit 07: Solutions & Energy**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U7) According to Table G, which substance is most soluble in water at 50 °C?  
   (A) NaCl  
   (B) KClO₃  
   (C) NH₄Cl  
   (D) KNO₃

   (A) 1.0 M  
   (B) 2.0 M  
   (C) 0.25 M  
   (D) 0.50 M  
   (Answer: C. M \= moles/L \= 0.50 mol / 2.0 L \= 0.25 M)  
4. (U7) Compared to the freezing point and boiling point of pure water, a 1.0 M solution of NaCl will have a:  
   (A) lower freezing point and a lower boiling point  
   (B) lower freezing point and a higher boiling point  
   (C) higher freezing point and a lower boiling point  
   (D) higher freezing point and a higher boiling point  
   (Answer: B)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U7) How many moles of solute are contained in 200\. mL of a 1.5 M solution?  
(Answer: First, convert volume to L: 200\. mL \= 0.200 L. Rearrange Molarity formula: moles \= M × L \= 1.5 mol/L × 0.200 L \= 0.30 moles.)

6. (U7) Explain why spreading salt (NaCl) on an icy sidewalk causes the ice to melt, even if the air temperature is below 0 °C.  
   (Answer: This is due to freezing point depression. Dissolving salt in the thin layer of water on the ice introduces solute particles, which disrupt the freezing process. This lowers the freezing point of the saltwater solution to below 0 °C, causing the ice to melt.)  
7. (U7) Based on Table G, if 30 grams of KClO₃ are dissolved in 100 grams of water at 70 °C, is the solution unsaturated, saturated, or supersaturated?  
   (Answer: At 70°C, the solubility of KClO₃ is approximately 33 g per 100 g of water. Since only 30 g are dissolved, the solution is unsaturated.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U7) How many Joules of heat are required to raise the temperature of 25.0 g of water from 20.0 °C to 50.0 °C? (The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g·°C).  
(Answer: Use q \= mCΔT. ΔT \= 50.0 °C \- 20.0 °C \= 30.0 °C.  
q \= (25.0 g) × (4.18 J/g·°C) × (30.0 °C) \= 3135 J \= 3140 J (to 3 sig figs).)

9. (U7) How much energy is required to completely melt a 50.0 g sample of ice at its melting point? (The heat of fusion of water is 334 J/g).  
   (Answer: Use q \= mHfus. q \= (50.0 g) \* (334 J/g) \= 16700 J or 16.7 kJ.)

Application:  
10\. (U7) A water quality report states that the concentration of lead in a drinking water sample is 0.012 ppm. If the sample has a total mass of 500.0 g, what is the mass of lead in the sample?  
(Answer: Rearrange the ppm formula: mass of solute \= (ppm × mass of solution) / 1,000,000.  
mass of lead \= (0.012 × 500.0 g) / 1,000,000 \= 0.000006 g or 6.0 µg.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U7) A 10.0 g cube of ice at 0 °C is placed into 90.0 g of water at 25.0 °C in a perfect calorimeter. What will be the final temperature of the water after all the ice has melted? (Hfus of water \= 334 J/g, C of water \= 4.18 J/g·°C).  
(Answer: This is a heat exchange problem. Heat lost by water \= Heat gained by ice to melt \+ Heat gained by melted ice water.  
(90.0)(4.18)(25.0 \- T\_f) \= (10.0)(334) \+ (10.0)(4.18)(T\_f \- 0\)  
9405 \- 376.2 T\_f \= 3340 \+ 41.8 T\_f  
6065 \= 418 T\_f  
T\_f \= 14.5 °C.)

### **Unit 08: Kinetics & Equilibrium**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. (U8) Increasing the temperature of a chemical reaction increases the reaction rate primarily because it:  
   (A) increases the concentration of the reactants.  
   (B) increases the frequency and energy of particle collisions.  
   (C) lowers the activation energy of the reaction.  
   (D) lowers the heat of reaction (ΔH).  
   (Answer: B)  
2. (U8) Given the system at equilibrium: 2SO₂(g) \+ O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g) \+ heat. Which change will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right?  
   (A) Adding a catalyst.  
   (B) Increasing the temperature.  
   (C) Increasing the concentration of SO₃.  
   (D) Increasing the pressure.  
   (Answer: D)  
3. (U8) A catalyst works by:  
   (A) increasing the kinetic energy of reactants.  
   (B) decreasing the potential energy of the products.  
   (C) providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.  
   (D) shifting the equilibrium position to favor the products.  
   (Answer: C)  
4. (U8) For a reaction to be at equilibrium, it must be true that:  
   (A) the concentrations of reactants and products are equal.  
   (B) the reaction has completely stopped.  
   (C) the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.  
   (D) the activation energy is equal to the heat of reaction.  
   (Answer: C)

Short Answer:  
5\. (U8) On a potential energy diagram, what is the effect of adding a catalyst on the activation energy and the heat of reaction (ΔH)?  
(Answer: Adding a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway. It has no effect on the heat of reaction (ΔH) because the potential energy of the reactants and products remains unchanged.)

6. (U8) Explain why crushing a solid reactant into a powder increases the rate of reaction.  
   (Answer: Crushing a solid increases its surface area. This exposes more of the reactant's particles, leading to more frequent collisions with the other reactants and therefore a faster reaction rate.)

Problem Solving:  
7\. (U8) Consider the equilibrium: H₂(g) \+ I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g). State the effect that each of the following changes will have on the concentration of HI.  
(a) Addition of H₂ gas.  
(b) Removal of I₂ gas.  
(c) Increasing the pressure.  
(Answer:  
(a) Increases the concentration of HI (shifts right).  
(b) Decreases the concentration of HI (shifts left).  
(c) No effect. (There are 2 moles of gas on the left and 2 moles of gas on the right, so pressure has no effect on the equilibrium position).)

8. (U8) For a given reaction, the activation energy is 150 kJ and the heat of reaction (ΔH) is \-50 kJ. What is the activation energy for the reverse reaction?  
   (Answer: The activation energy for the reverse reaction is the energy from the products to the activated complex. It would be Ea(forward) \- ΔH \= 150 kJ \- (-50 kJ) \= 200 kJ.)

Application:  
9\. (U8) Food is often stored in a refrigerator to prevent it from spoiling. Using your knowledge of kinetics, explain why refrigeration is an effective method of food preservation.  
(Answer: Spoiling is caused by chemical reactions (often carried out by bacteria). A refrigerator lowers the temperature. According to kinetics, decreasing the temperature decreases the kinetic energy of particles, which slows down the rate of chemical reactions. By slowing down the spoilage reactions, refrigeration keeps food fresh for longer.)

10. (U8) The production of methanol is given by: CO(g) \+ 2H₂(g) ⇌ CH₃OH(g). If the pressure on this system at equilibrium is increased, which way will the equilibrium shift? Explain.  
    (Answer: The equilibrium will shift to the right. The reactant side has 3 moles of gas (1+2), and the product side has 1 mole of gas. According to Le Châtelier's principle, increasing the pressure will cause the system to shift toward the side with fewer moles of gas to relieve the stress.)

Extension:  
11\. (U8) The industrial production of ammonia via the Haber process (N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) \+ heat) is a crucial equilibrium reaction. To maximize the yield of ammonia (NH₃), would you recommend using high or low temperatures, and high or low pressures? Explain your reasoning for each.  
(Answer:  
Pressure: You would use high pressure. The product side has fewer moles of gas (2 moles) than the reactant side (4 moles). According to Le Châtelier's principle, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the production of more ammonia.  
Temperature: From a purely equilibrium standpoint, you would use low temperature. The forward reaction is exothermic. Decreasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the right to produce more heat, thus favoring the production of more ammonia. (In reality, the industrial process uses a compromise temperature that is high enough for a reasonable reaction rate but low enough for a favorable equilibrium position).)

   (D) hydronium ion acceptor  
   (Answer: B)  
4. (U9) Which of the following is an electrolyte?

5\. (U9) In the reaction NH₃(g) \+ H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) \+ OH⁻(aq), identify one Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair.  
(Answer: Either NH₃/NH₄⁺ or H₂O/OH⁻. For NH₃/NH₄⁺, NH₃ is the base and NH₄⁺ is its conjugate acid.)

6. (U9) What are the two products of a neutralization reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)?  
   (Answer: Water (H₂O) and a salt, potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄).)  
7. (U9) Why is phenolphthalein a good indicator for a titration of a strong acid with a strong base, but a poor choice for a titration that has an equivalence point at pH 4? (Refer to Table M).  
   (Answer: Phenolphthalein changes color in the pH range of 8-9. This is ideal for a strong acid-strong base titration, which has an equivalence point at pH 7 (the indicator changes color right after equivalence). It is a poor choice for an equivalence point at pH 4 because the solution would still be acidic when the indicator is colorless, so no color change would be observed at the correct point.)

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U9) In a titration, 25.0 mL of 0.200 M NaOH is used to completely neutralize 40.0 mL of HCl. What is the molarity of the HCl solution?  
(Answer: Use MₐVₐ \= MᵦVᵦ.  
Mₐ × (40.0 mL) \= (0.200 M) × (25.0 mL)  
Mₐ \= (0.200 M × 25.0 mL) / 40.0 mL \= 0.125 M.)

9. (U9) What is the pH of a 0.001 M solution of HCl, assuming it is a strong acid that completely dissociates?  
   (Answer: Since HCl is a strong acid, \[H⁺\] \= 0.001 M or 1 x 10⁻³ M. The pH \= \-log\[H⁺\] \= \-log(10⁻³) \= 3.)

Application:  
10\. (U9) A student is testing a clear, unknown solution. They find that it turns blue litmus paper red and causes magnesium metal to bubble. Based on these two tests, is the solution likely an acid or a base? Justify your answer.  
(Answer: The solution is an acid. Turning blue litmus red is a characteristic property of acids. Reacting with an active metal like magnesium to produce bubbles (hydrogen gas) is also a characteristic reaction of acids.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U9) The salt ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) dissolves in water to produce a slightly acidic solution (pH \< 7). Using the Brønsted-Lowry theory, explain why this happens. Hint: Consider how the NH₄⁺ ion might react with water.  
(Answer: When NH₄Cl dissolves, it dissociates into NH₄⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. The ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) is the conjugate acid of the weak base ammonia (NH₃). Therefore, the NH₄⁺ ion can act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid and donate a proton to a water molecule, according to the reaction: NH₄⁺ \+ H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ \+ NH₃. This reaction produces hydronium ions (H₃O⁺), which increases the \[H⁺\] concentration in the solution and makes it acidic.)

(Answer: The oxidation state of Sn increases from \+2 to \+4, so Sn²⁺ is oxidized. The oxidation state of Fe decreases from \+3 to \+2, so Fe³⁺ is reduced.)

6. (U10) What is the purpose of the salt bridge in a voltaic cell?  
   (Answer: The salt bridge allows for the migration of ions between the two half-cells. This maintains electrical neutrality in each half-cell by balancing the charge buildup that occurs as the reaction proceeds, which completes the circuit and allows the cell to operate.)  
7. (U10) In a voltaic cell, electrons always flow from the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Problem Solving:  
8\. (U10) Write the balanced oxidation and reduction half-reactions for the following unbalanced redox reaction: Al(s) \+ Ag⁺(aq) → Al³⁺(aq) \+ Ag(s).  
(Answer:  
Oxidation: Al → Al³⁺ \+ 3e⁻  
Reduction: Ag⁺ \+ e⁻ → Ag. To balance electrons with the oxidation half-reaction, it must be 3Ag⁺ \+ 3e⁻ → 3Ag.)

9. (U10) What is the oxidation number of chromium (Cr) in the polyatomic ion Cr₂O₇²⁻?  
   (Answer: Let the oxidation number of Cr be x. The oxidation number of O is \-2. The sum must equal the ion's charge of \-2.  
   2(x) \+ 7(-2) \= \-2  
   2x \- 14 \= \-2  
   2x \= 12  
   x \= \+6)

(a) Should the ring be the anode or the cathode?  
(b) What should the other electrode be made of?  
(c) What should the electrolyte solution contain?  
(Answer:  
(a) The ring should be the cathode, where reduction (plating) occurs.  
(b) The other electrode (the anode) should be made of pure silver (Ag).  
(c) The electrolyte solution should contain silver ions (e.g., silver nitrate, AgNO₃). )

11\. (U10) Using Table J (Activity Series) in the NYS Reference Tables, predict whether a spontaneous reaction will occur if a strip of zinc metal is placed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄). Justify your answer.  
(Answer: Yes, a spontaneous reaction will occur. According to Table J, zinc (Zn) is listed above copper (Cu). This means zinc is more active and more easily oxidized than copper. Therefore, the zinc metal will spontaneously replace the copper ions in the solution, according to the reaction: Zn(s) \+ CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) \+ Cu(s).)

6. (U11) Explain the difference between a substitution reaction and an addition reaction.  
   (Answer: A substitution reaction involves replacing an atom on a saturated molecule (like an alkane), resulting in two products. An addition reaction involves adding atoms to an unsaturated molecule by breaking a double or triple bond, resulting in only one product.)  
7. (U11) Identify the class of organic compound to which CH₃OCH₂CH₃ belongs.  
   (Answer: It is an ether.)

Problem Solving:

(Answer: The "ethyl" part of the name comes from the alcohol, ethanol. The "butanoate" part comes from the organic acid, butanoic acid.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U11) The compounds diethyl ether (CH₃CH₂OCH₂CH₃) and 1-butanol (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH) are isomers with the formula C₄H₁₀O. Predict which compound has a significantly higher boiling point and explain your choice in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: 1-butanol will have a much higher boiling point. Although they have the same molar mass, 1-butanol is an alcohol and has a polar \-OH group, which allows it to form strong hydrogen bonds between its molecules. Diethyl ether is an ether; it is slightly polar but cannot form hydrogen bonds with itself. The strong hydrogen bonds in 1-butanol require much more energy to overcome than the weaker dipole-dipole and dispersion forces in diethyl ether.)

6. (U12) State one major advantage of fusion over fission as a source of energy.  
   (Answer: Fusion produces significantly more energy per gram of fuel, its fuel source (hydrogen isotopes from water) is abundant, and it produces less long-lived radioactive waste.)  
7. (U12) Explain the source of the large amount of energy released in nuclear reactions like fission and fusion.  
   (Answer: The energy comes from the conversion of a small amount of mass (called mass defect) directly into energy, according to Einstein's equation E=mc².)

(Answer: For 1/4 of the sample to remain, two half-lives must have passed (1/2 → 1/4). The age of the artifact is 2 × 5730 years \= 11,460 years.)  
Extension:  
11\. (U12) A patient is given a medical treatment with a radioisotope that has a half-life of 12 hours. Explain why an isotope with a very long half-life (e.g., thousands of years) would be unsuitable and potentially dangerous for this type of medical application.  
(Answer: An isotope with a long half-life would remain radioactive inside the patient's body for a very long time. This would lead to prolonged exposure to radiation, significantly increasing the risk of cellular damage and cancer. Medical isotopes need to have a short half-life so that they decay to a stable, non-radioactive form quickly after they have served their diagnostic or therapeutic purpose, minimizing the radiation dose to the patient.)
