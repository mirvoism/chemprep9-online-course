### **Unit 09: Acids, Bases & Salts**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit introduces two of the most important and common classes of chemical compounds: acids and bases. You will learn to identify them based on their distinct properties—like the sour taste of acids and the slippery feel of bases—and by their chemical definitions. We'll explore the classic Arrhenius theory, which defines acids and bases by the ions they produce in water, as well as the broader Brønsted-Lowry theory, which redefines them as proton donors and acceptors. A central focus will be the **pH scale**, which we'll use to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. You'll become proficient in using indicators to estimate pH and understand the process of **neutralization**, the reaction where an acid and a base cancel each other out to form water and a salt. This leads to the practical and precise lab technique of **titration**, used to determine an unknown concentration. Finally, you'll learn what salts are and how they behave as electrolytes in solution.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Define and identify acids and bases using the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry theories.  
* List the characteristic properties of acids and bases.  
* Use the pH scale to describe the acidity or basicity of a solution and select appropriate indicators.  
* Write and balance neutralization reactions.  
* Perform calculations related to the titration of an acid with a base.  
* Define salts and classify substances as strong electrolytes, weak electrolytes, or nonelectrolytes.

### **Sub-Unit 9.1: Properties of Acids & Bases (Arrhenius Theory)**

The **Arrhenius theory** provides the first modern definition of acids and bases.

* An **Arrhenius acid** is a substance that contains hydrogen and dissociates in water to produce hydrogen ions (**H⁺**). In reality, H⁺ ions attach to water molecules to form hydronium ions (**H₃O⁺**). For simplicity, we often use H⁺ and H₃O⁺ interchangeably.  
  * Example: HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) \+ Cl⁻(aq)  
* An **Arrhenius base** is a substance that contains a hydroxide group and dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions (**OH⁻**).  
  * Example: NaOH(s) → Na⁺(aq) \+ OH⁻(aq)

**Characteristic Properties:**

| Acids | Bases |
| :---- | :---- |
| Taste sour | Taste bitter |
| Feel like water | Feel slippery |
| Turn blue litmus paper **red** | Turn red litmus paper **blue** |
| React with active metals to produce H₂ gas | Do not react with most metals |
| Are electrolytes | Are electrolytes |

### **Sub-Unit 9.2: Brønsted-Lowry Theory & Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs**

The Brønsted-Lowry theory provides a broader definition that is not limited to aqueous solutions.

* A **Brønsted-Lowry acid** is a **proton (H⁺) donor**.  
* A **Brønsted-Lowry base** is a **proton (H⁺) acceptor**.

Consider the reaction: HCl \+ H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ \+ Cl⁻

* HCl donates a proton to H₂O, so HCl is the **acid**.  
* H₂O accepts the proton from HCl, so H₂O is the **base**.

A key feature of this theory is the concept of **conjugate acid-base pairs**. These are two substances related to each other by the gain or loss of a single proton.

* In the reverse reaction, H₃O⁺ donates a proton, making it the **conjugate acid**.  
* Cl⁻ is what's left after HCl donated its proton, making it the **conjugate base**.  
* The pairs are: HCl/Cl⁻ and H₃O⁺/H₂O.

**Amphoteric Substances:** Some substances, like water, can act as either an acid or a base, depending on what they react with. These are called amphoteric.

### **Sub-Unit 9.3: The pH Scale & Indicators**

The **pH scale** is a logarithmic scale, typically ranging from 0 to 14, that measures the concentration of H⁺ ions in a solution.

* **pH \< 7:** The solution is **acidic** (\[H⁺\] \> \[OH⁻\]).  
* **pH \= 7:** The solution is **neutral** (\[H⁺\] \= \[OH⁻\]).  
* **pH \> 7:** The solution is **basic** or **alkaline** (\[H⁺\] \< \[OH⁻\]).

Because the scale is logarithmic, a change of **1 pH unit** represents a **tenfold (10x)** change in H⁺ concentration. For example, a solution with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5\.

**Indicators** are weak acids or bases that change color over a specific pH range. They are used to give a visual estimate of a solution's pH. You must choose an indicator that changes color within the pH range you are interested in (see Table M in the NYS Reference Tables). For example, litmus is red in acid and blue in base, while phenolphthalein is colorless in acid and pink in base.

### **Sub-Unit 9.4: Neutralization Reactions & Titrations**

A **neutralization reaction** occurs when an acid and a base react to form water and an ionic compound called a **salt**.

* General Equation: Acid \+ Base → Salt \+ Water  
* Example: HCl(aq) \+ NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) \+ H₂O(l)  
* The net ionic equation for the neutralization of a strong acid and strong base is always: H⁺(aq) \+ OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)

**Titration** is a laboratory technique used to determine the unknown concentration of an acid or base by slowly adding a solution of known concentration (the "standard solution") until neutralization is complete. The point at which the moles of H⁺ equal the moles of OH⁻ is called the **equivalence point**. An indicator is used to signal the **endpoint** of the titration, which is very close to the equivalence point.

The following formula is used for titration calculations:

* Formula: MₐVₐ \= MᵦVᵦ  
  * Mₐ \= Molarity of the acid  
  * Vₐ \= Volume of the acid  
  * Mᵦ \= Molarity of the base  
  * Vᵦ \= Volume of the base  
  * **Note:** This simple formula only works for acids and bases with a 1:1 mole ratio of H⁺ to OH⁻ (e.g., HCl and NaOH). For others (like H₂SO₄ and NaOH), you must use mole ratios.

### **Sub-Unit 9.5: Salts & Electrolytes**

A **salt** is an ionic compound composed of a cation from a base and an anion from an acid.

An **electrolyte** is a substance that conducts electricity when dissolved in water because it dissociates to produce mobile ions.

* **Strong Electrolytes:** Substances that completely dissociate into ions in water. This includes all soluble salts, strong acids, and strong bases. They are excellent conductors.  
* **Weak Electrolytes:** Substances that only partially dissociate into ions. This includes weak acids and weak bases. They are poor conductors.  
* **Nonelectrolytes:** Covalent (molecular) substances that do not form ions when dissolved in water. They do not conduct electricity. Sugar is a common example.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 9.3:** A "Virtual pH Probe." Students can drag a pH probe into various household solutions (lemon juice, soap, water, vinegar) and see the pH value displayed on a meter. An accompanying color chart would show how different indicators (litmus, phenolphthalein) would appear at that pH.  
* **For 9.4:** An "Online Titration Lab." This simulation would allow students to perform a virtual titration. They would fill a buret with a standard solution, add an indicator to a flask containing an unknown, and carefully add the titrant drop-by-drop until the endpoint is reached. The simulation would then let them use the MₐVₐ \= MᵦVᵦ formula to calculate the unknown concentration.  
* **For 9.5:** An "Electrolyte Conductivity Tester." Students can choose different solutes (salt, sugar, weak acid) to dissolve in water and then dip virtual electrodes into the solution. A light bulb connected to the circuit would glow brightly for strong electrolytes, dimly for weak electrolytes, and not at all for nonelectrolytes.

Short Answer:  
3\. In the reaction NH₃(g) \+ H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) \+ OH⁻(aq), identify one Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair.  
(Answer: Either NH₃/NH₄⁺ or H₂O/OH⁻. For NH₃/NH₄⁺, NH₃ is the base and NH₄⁺ is its conjugate acid.)

4. What are the two products of a neutralization reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)?  
   (Answer: Water (H₂O) and a salt, potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄).)

Problem Solving:  
5\. In a titration, 25.0 mL of 0.200 M NaOH is used to completely neutralize 40.0 mL of HCl. What is the molarity of the HCl solution?  
(Answer: Use MₐVₐ \= MᵦVᵦ.  
Mₐ × (40.0 mL) \= (0.200 M) × (25.0 mL)  
Mₐ \= (0.200 M × 25.0 mL) / 40.0 mL \= 0.125 M.)  
Application:  
6\. A student is testing a clear, unknown solution. They find that it turns blue litmus paper red and causes magnesium metal to bubble. Based on these two tests, is the solution likely an acid or a base? Justify your answer.  
(Answer: The solution is an acid. Turning blue litmus red is a characteristic property of acids. Reacting with an active metal like magnesium to produce bubbles (hydrogen gas) is also a characteristic reaction of acids.)  
Extension:  
7\. The salt ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) dissolves in water to produce a slightly acidic solution (pH \< 7). Using the Brønsted-Lowry theory, explain why this happens. Hint: Consider how the NH₄⁺ ion might react with water.  
(Answer: When NH₄Cl dissolves, it dissociates into NH₄⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. The ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) is the conjugate acid of the weak base ammonia (NH₃). Therefore, the NH₄⁺ ion can act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid and donate a proton to a water molecule, according to the reaction: NH₄⁺ \+ H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ \+ NH₃. This reaction produces hydronium ions (H₃O⁺), which increases the \[H⁺\] concentration in the solution and makes it acidic.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Acids, bases, and salts are integral to our daily lives. **Acids** are found in our foods (citric acid in lemons, acetic acid in vinegar) and in our stomachs (hydrochloric acid) to aid digestion. **Bases** are used in cleaning products like soap, drain cleaner (NaOH), and antacids that neutralize excess stomach acid. **Neutralization** is used in agriculture to adjust soil pH and in wastewater treatment plants. The concept of **pH** is critical for maintaining healthy swimming pools, aquariums, and even our own blood, which must be kept within a very narrow pH range. And **electrolytes** (salts dissolved in water) are essential for nerve function and are the key ingredients in sports drinks designed to replenish what our bodies lose during exercise.

### **Go Deeper: Weak Acid Equilibrium & Ka**

While strong acids (like HCl) dissociate 100% in water, **weak acids** (like acetic acid, HC₂H₃O₂) only partially dissociate, establishing an equilibrium.

HC₂H₃O₂(aq) \+ H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) \+ C₂H₃O₂⁻(aq)

Because this is an equilibrium, we can write an equilibrium constant expression for it. For acids, this is called the **acid dissociation constant (Ka)**.

Ka \= (\[H₃O⁺\]\[C₂H₃O₂⁻\]) / \[HC₂H₃O₂\]

* The value of **Ka** is a measure of acid strength.  
  * A **large Ka** value (\>1) means the products are favored, so the acid dissociates extensively (strong acid).  
  * A **small Ka** value (\<1) means the reactants are favored, so the acid barely dissociates (weak acid). For acetic acid, Ka \= 1.8 × 10⁻⁵, indicating it is a very weak acid.

Calculating the pH of a Weak Acid Solution:  
We can use the Ka value to estimate the pH of a weak acid solution.  
**Example:** Calculate the pH of a 0.10 M solution of acetic acid (HC₂H₃O₂), given Ka \= 1.8 × 10⁻⁵.

1. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) and let 'x' be the change in concentration as the acid dissociates.  
   | | HC₂H₃O₂ | H₃O⁺ | C₂H₃O₂⁻ |  
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |  
   | I | 0.10 | 0 | 0 |  
   | C | \-x | \+x | \+x |  
   | E | 0.10 \- x | x | x |  
2. Write the Ka expression and substitute the equilibrium values.  
   Ka \= (x \* x) / (0.10 \- x)  
   1.8 × 10⁻⁵ \= x² / (0.10 \- x)  
3. Make a simplifying assumption. Because Ka is very small, we know that 'x' (the amount that dissociates) will be tiny compared to the initial concentration (0.10 M). We can assume that 0.10 \- x ≈ 0.10. This avoids using the quadratic formula.  
   1.8 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ x² / 0.10  
4. Solve for x.  
   x² \= (1.8 × 10⁻⁵) \* 0.10 \= 1.8 × 10⁻⁶  
   x \= √(1.8 × 10⁻⁶) \= 1.34 × 10⁻³ M  
   Since x \= \[H₃O⁺\], we now have the hydronium ion concentration.  
5. Calculate the pH.  
   pH \= \-log\[H₃O⁺\] \= \-log(1.34 × 10⁻³) \= 2.87

The pH of the 0.10 M weak acetic acid solution is 2.87. (Note: A 0.10 M solution of a strong acid like HCl would have a pH of 1.0).
