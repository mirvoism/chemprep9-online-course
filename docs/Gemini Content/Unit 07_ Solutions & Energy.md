### **Unit 07: Solutions & Energy**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit merges the concepts of mixtures and energy, exploring how substances dissolve and the energy changes that accompany physical and chemical processes. We'll start by defining solutions and investigating the factors that affect how well a substance dissolves, learning to read solubility curves to predict saturation. You will master different ways to express the concentration of a solution, such as molarity and parts per million. We'll then examine the interesting "colligative properties" of solutions, seeing how adding a solute can change a solvent's freezing and boiling points. The second half of the unit dives into **thermochemistry**, the study of heat changes in reactions. You'll learn to distinguish between endothermic (heat-absorbing) and exothermic (heat-releasing) processes and use potential energy diagrams to visualize these changes. You will become proficient in performing calorimetry calculations to determine the amount of heat absorbed or released during temperature changes and phase changes, tying back to our study of heating curves.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Define solutions and describe factors affecting solubility, including the "like dissolves like" rule.  
* Interpret solubility curves to determine if a solution is saturated, unsaturated, or supersaturated.  
* Calculate the concentration of a solution in terms of molarity and parts per million (ppm).  
* Describe the effects of a solute on the freezing and boiling points of a solvent (colligative properties).  
* Differentiate between endothermic and exothermic processes and interpret potential energy diagrams.  
* Perform calculations involving heat, specific heat capacity, mass, and temperature change (q \= mCΔT).  
* Calculate the heat absorbed or released during a phase change using the heat of fusion and heat of vaporization.

### **Sub-Unit 7.1: The Nature of Solutions & Factors Affecting Solubility**

A **solution** is a homogeneous mixture composed of a **solute** (the substance being dissolved) and a **solvent** (the substance doing the dissolving). The solvent is typically present in the larger amount. When the solvent is water, the solution is called an **aqueous solution**.

**Solubility** is the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature. The key principle governing solubility is **"like dissolves like."**

* **Polar solvents** (like water) tend to dissolve **polar solutes** (like sugar) and **ionic solutes** (like salt).  
* **Nonpolar solvents** (like oil or hexane) tend to dissolve **nonpolar solutes** (like grease).

**Factors Affecting Solubility:**

* **Temperature:**  
  * For most **solids** dissolving in a liquid, solubility **increases** as temperature increases.  
  * For all **gases** dissolving in a liquid, solubility **decreases** as temperature increases (warm soda goes flat faster).  
* **Pressure:**  
  * Has little to no effect on the solubility of solids or liquids.  
  * For **gases**, solubility is **directly proportional** to the pressure of the gas above the liquid (Henry's Law). This is why soda is carbonated under high pressure.

**Solubility curves** are graphs that show the solubility of substances at different temperatures. Using a solubility curve (like Table G in the NYS Reference Tables), you can determine if a solution is:

* **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the maximum it can hold. (Point is below the line).  
* **Saturated:** Contains the maximum amount of solute it can hold. (Point is on the line).  
* **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than it can normally hold. This is an unstable state created by cooling a saturated solution carefully. (Point is above the line).

### **Sub-Unit 7.2: Concentration Units (Molarity, Parts Per Million)**

**Concentration** is a measure of the amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution.

* **Molarity (M):** The most common unit of concentration in chemistry. It is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  
  * Formula: Molarity (M) \= moles of solute / Liters of solution  
* **Parts Per Million (ppm):** Used for very dilute solutions, often in environmental science.  
  * Formula: ppm \= (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 1,000,000

### **Sub-Unit 7.3: Colligative Properties**

**Colligative properties** are properties of a solution that depend only on the **number of solute particles** dissolved, not on the identity of the solute particles.

Adding a nonvolatile solute to a solvent causes:

* **Freezing Point Depression:** The freezing point of the solution is **lower** than the freezing point of the pure solvent.  
* **Boiling Point Elevation:** The boiling point of the solution is **higher** than the boiling point of the pure solvent.

The magnitude of the change is proportional to the concentration of dissolved particles. For example, dissolving 1 mole of salt (NaCl), which dissociates into two ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻), will lower the freezing point about twice as much as dissolving 1 mole of sugar (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁), which does not dissociate. This is why salt is spread on icy roads.

### **Sub-Unit 7.4: Thermochemistry: Endothermic vs. Exothermic**

**Thermochemistry** is the study of energy and heat associated with chemical reactions and physical transformations.

* **Exothermic Process:** A process that **releases** heat into the surroundings. The surroundings get warmer. The energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants. The change in enthalpy (heat), **ΔH**, is **negative**.  
  * Examples: Burning wood, freezing water, a "hot pack."  
* **Endothermic Process:** A process that **absorbs** heat from the surroundings. The surroundings get colder. The energy of the products is higher than the energy of the reactants. The change in enthalpy, **ΔH**, is **positive**.  
  * Examples: Melting ice, cooking an egg, a chemical "cold pack."

**Potential Energy Diagrams** can be used to visualize these changes, showing the relative potential energy of reactants and products and the activation energy of the reaction.

### **Sub-Unit 7.5: Heat Calculations & Calorimetry (q \= mCΔT)**

**Heat (q)** is a form of energy that flows from a warmer object to a cooler object. The amount of heat absorbed or released when the temperature of a substance changes can be calculated using the following formula:

* Formula: q \= mCΔT  
  * q \= heat (in Joules, J)  
  * m \= mass of the substance (in grams, g)  
  * C \= **specific heat capacity** of the substance (the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1g of the substance by 1°C or 1K). For water, C \= 4.18 J/g·K.  
  * ΔT \= change in temperature (ΔT \= T\_final \- T\_initial)

**Calorimetry** is the science of measuring heat flow using an insulated device called a calorimeter.

### **Sub-Unit 7.6: Heats of Reaction, Fusion & Vaporization**

When a substance undergoes a phase change, the temperature remains constant, so the q \= mCΔT equation cannot be used. Instead, we use the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization.

* **Heat of Fusion (Hfus):** The amount of heat required to melt one gram of a substance at its melting point.  
  * Formula: q \= mHfus  
  * For water, Hfus \= 334 J/g.  
* **Heat of Vaporization (Hvap):** The amount of heat required to vaporize one gram of a substance at its boiling point.  
  * Formula: q \= mHvap  
  * For water, Hvap \= 2260 J/g.

These values can also be used for the exothermic processes of freezing (q \= \-mHfus) and condensation (q \= \-mHvap).

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 7.1:** An interactive "Solubility Curve Lab." Students can adjust the temperature of a beaker of water and add different amounts of solutes (like KNO₃ or NaCl). The interactive would graph the point on a solubility curve and label the solution as unsaturated, saturated, or supersaturated.  
* **For 7.2:** A "Molarity Calculator" simulation. Students are given a virtual balance, a variety of solutes, and volumetric flasks. They must measure out the correct mass of a solute and add the correct amount of water to create a solution of a target molarity.  
* **For 7.5 & 7.6:** A "Virtual Calorimeter." Students can place a sample of ice in a calorimeter, add heat, and watch the heating curve be generated in real-time. They can then use the q=mCΔT and q=mHfus/vap formulas to calculate the total energy absorbed, checking their answer against the simulation's value.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. According to Table G, which substance is most soluble in water at 50 °C?  
   (A) NaCl  
   (B) KClO₃  
   (C) NH₄Cl  
   (D) KNO₃  
   (Answer: D)  
2. A process that absorbs heat from the surroundings is called:  
   (A) Isotopic  
   (B) Exothermic  
   (C) Endothermic  
   (D) Isomeric  
   (Answer: C)

Short Answer:  
3\. How many moles of solute are contained in 200\. mL of a 1.5 M solution?  
(Answer: First, convert volume to L: 200\. mL \= 0.200 L. Rearrange Molarity formula: moles \= M × L \= 1.5 mol/L × 0.200 L \= 0.30 moles.)

4. Explain why spreading salt (NaCl) on an icy sidewalk causes the ice to melt, even if the air temperature is below 0 °C.  
   (Answer: This is due to freezing point depression. Dissolving salt in the thin layer of water on the ice introduces solute particles, which disrupt the freezing process. This lowers the freezing point of the saltwater solution to below 0 °C, causing the ice to melt.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. How many Joules of heat are required to raise the temperature of 25.0 g of water from 20.0 °C to 50.0 °C? (The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g·°C).  
(Answer: Use q \= mCΔT. ΔT \= 50.0 °C \- 20.0 °C \= 30.0 °C.  
q \= (25.0 g) × (4.18 J/g·°C) × (30.0 °C) \= 3135 J \= 3140 J (to 3 sig figs).)  
Application:  
6\. A water quality report states that the concentration of lead in a drinking water sample is 0.012 ppm. If the sample has a total mass of 500.0 g, what is the mass of lead in the sample?  
(Answer: Rearrange the ppm formula: mass of solute \= (ppm × mass of solution) / 1,000,000.  
mass of lead \= (0.012 × 500.0 g) / 1,000,000 \= 0.000006 g or 6.0 µg.)  
Extension:  
7\. A 10.0 g cube of ice at 0 °C is placed into 90.0 g of water at 25.0 °C in a perfect calorimeter. What will be the final temperature of the water after all the ice has melted? (Hfus of water \= 334 J/g).  
(Answer: This is a heat exchange problem. Heat lost by water \= Heat gained by ice.  
Heat gained by ice to melt: q\_melt \= mHfus \= (10.0 g)(334 J/g) \= 3340 J.  
Heat lost by water: q\_lost \= mCΔT \= (90.0 g)(4.18 J/g·°C)(25.0 \- T\_final).  
Heat gained by melted ice (now water): q\_gain \= mCΔT \= (10.0 g)(4.18 J/g·°C)(T\_final \- 0).  
Set up the energy balance: q\_lost \= q\_melt \+ q\_gain  
(90)(4.18)(25 \- T\_f) \= 3340 \+ (10)(4.18)(T\_f)  
9405 \- 376.2 T\_f \= 3340 \+ 41.8 T\_f  
6065 \= 418 T\_f  
T\_f \= 14.5 °C.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

The concepts in this unit are essential for everyday life and industry. **Solubility** and **concentration** are critical in medicine for creating IV solutions and proper drug dosages. **Colligative properties** are used in making antifreeze for car engines and in cooking to elevate the boiling point of water. **Thermochemistry** governs everything from the energy we get from food (measured in Calories, a unit of heat) to the operation of hand warmers (**exothermic** reactions) and instant cold packs (**endothermic** processes). Understanding heat transfer is fundamental to designing efficient heating and cooling systems, engines, and power plants.

### **Go Deeper: Hess's Law & Enthalpies of Formation**

While calorimetry allows us to measure the heat of a reaction (ΔH) directly, it's not always practical or possible to do so. What if a reaction is too slow, too dangerous, or has too many side products? Chemists can calculate the ΔH of a reaction indirectly using two powerful tools.

Hess's Law of Heat Summation:  
This law states that if a reaction can be written as the sum of two or more other reactions, the overall ΔH for the reaction is the sum of the ΔH values for the individual steps. This means that the total enthalpy change is independent of the pathway taken.  
**Example:** Calculate the ΔH for the reaction C(s) \+ O₂(g) → CO₂(g) using the following steps:

1. C(s) \+ ½O₂(g) → CO(g) ΔH₁ \= \-110.5 kJ  
2. CO(g) \+ ½O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ΔH₂ \= \-283.0 kJ

To get the overall reaction, we simply add the two steps together. The CO(g) is an intermediate that appears on both the product and reactant side, so it cancels out.  
C(s) \+ ½O₂(g) \+ CO(g) \+ ½O₂(g) → CO(g) \+ CO₂(g)  
C(s) \+ O₂(g) → CO₂(g)  
According to Hess's Law, we can also add the ΔH values:  
ΔH\_overall \= ΔH₁ \+ ΔH₂ \= (-110.5 kJ) \+ (-283.0 kJ) \= \-393.5 kJ  
Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH°f):  
The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states (usually at 25°C and 1 atm). By definition, the ΔH°f for any pure element in its standard state is zero.  
We can use a table of known ΔH°f values to calculate the enthalpy change for any reaction using the following formula:

ΔH°\_reaction \= Σ ΔH°f (products) \- Σ ΔH°f (reactants)

(Where Σ means "the sum of")

Example: Calculate the ΔH for the combustion of methane: CH₄(g) \+ 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) \+ 2H₂O(l)  
Given Standard Enthalpies of Formation:

* ΔH°f (CH₄) \= \-74.8 kJ/mol  
* ΔH°f (O₂) \= 0 kJ/mol (element in standard state)  
* ΔH°f (CO₂) \= \-393.5 kJ/mol  
* ΔH°f (H₂O) \= \-285.8 kJ/mol

Calculation:  
ΔH°\_reaction \= \[ΔH°f(CO₂) \+ 2\*ΔH°f(H₂O)\] \- \[ΔH°f(CH₄) \+ 2\*ΔH°f(O₂)\]  
ΔH°\_reaction \= \[(-393.5) \+ 2(-285.8)\] \- \[(-74.8) \+ 2(0)\]  
ΔH°\_reaction \= \[-393.5 \- 571.6\] \- \[-74.8\]  
ΔH°\_reaction \= \[-965.1\] \+ 74.8 \= \-890.3 kJ  
The reaction is highly exothermic, as expected for combustion.
