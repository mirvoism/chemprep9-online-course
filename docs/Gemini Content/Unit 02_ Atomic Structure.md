### **Unit 02: Atomic Structure**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit takes you on a journey into the very heart of matter: the atom. We'll start by traveling back in time to see how our understanding of the atom evolved, from early ideas of simple, solid spheres to the complex and fascinating model we use today. You'll get to know the three key subatomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons—and understand their specific roles, charges, and locations within the atom. We will explore how the number of these particles defines an element's identity, determines its mass, and creates different versions of elements called isotopes. A key focus will be learning how to calculate the average atomic mass, which is the value you see on the periodic table. Finally, we'll investigate the world of electrons, learning how they are arranged in specific energy levels and how their movement creates the beautiful, colorful bright-line spectra that are like unique fingerprints for each element.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Describe the key contributions of Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, and Bohr to the development of the atomic model.  
* Identify the charge, mass, and location of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  
* Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in neutral atoms and ions using atomic number and mass number.  
* Define isotopes and calculate the average atomic mass of an element from isotopic abundance.  
* Write electron configurations for elements and identify valence electrons.  
* Explain the relationship between electron transitions (excited state to ground state) and the production of bright-line spectra.

### **Sub-Unit 2.1: Historical Models of the Atom**

Our modern picture of the atom wasn't discovered overnight; it was built over centuries by many scientists, each adding a crucial piece to the puzzle.

* **Dalton's Model (\~1803):** John Dalton imagined the atom as a tiny, solid, indivisible "billiard ball." His theory proposed that all matter is made of atoms, atoms of a given element are identical, and atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds.  
* **Thomson's Model (\~1897):** J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, a tiny, negatively charged particle. This shattered the idea of an indivisible atom. He proposed the "plum pudding" model, where negative electrons were embedded in a sphere of positive charge, like plums in a pudding.  
* **Rutherford's Model (\~1911):** Ernest Rutherford's famous gold foil experiment led to a major breakthrough. He fired tiny, positive alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Most passed straight through, but a few were dramatically deflected. This meant the atom was mostly empty space, with a tiny, dense, positively charged **nucleus** at its center. His model showed a positive nucleus with electrons orbiting it.  
* **Bohr's Model (\~1913):** Niels Bohr refined Rutherford's model by proposing that electrons travel in specific, fixed orbits, or **energy levels**, around the nucleus, much like planets orbiting the sun. Electrons could jump to higher orbits by absorbing energy and fall back to lower orbits by emitting energy as light.

### **Sub-Unit 2.2: The Modern (Wave-Mechanical) Model & Subatomic Particles**

The current model, known as the **wave-mechanical** or **electron cloud model**, is more complex. It states that we cannot know the exact path of an electron. Instead, electrons exist in **orbitals**, which are three-dimensional regions around the nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron. Think of it like the blades of a spinning fan—you know the blades are somewhere in that blurry region, but you can't pinpoint one at any given moment.

The atom is composed of three fundamental subatomic particles:

| Particle | Symbol | Relative Charge | Relative Mass (amu) | Location |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Proton** | p⁺ | \+1 | 1 | In the nucleus |
| **Neutron** | n⁰ | 0 | 1 | In the nucleus |
| **Electron** | e⁻ | \-1 | \~1/1836 (negligible) | In orbitals outside the nucleus |

The nucleus is the atom's core, containing protons and neutrons. It is extremely dense and has an overall positive charge. The electrons occupy the space surrounding the nucleus, which is mostly empty space.

### **Sub-Unit 2.3: Atomic Number, Mass Number, and Isotopes**

We can describe the composition of any atom using a few key numbers.

* **Atomic Number (Z):** This is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. It is the single most important number for an element because it defines its identity. Every atom of gold has 79 protons; if it had 78, it would be platinum. In a neutral atom, the atomic number also equals the number of electrons.  
* Mass Number (A): This is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. It represents the approximate mass of the atom in atomic mass units (amu).  
  Mass Number \= (Number of Protons) \+ (Number of Neutrons)

From this, we can find the number of neutrons:  
Number of Neutrons \= Mass Number \- Atomic Number

* **Isotopes:** These are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but **different numbers of neutrons**. This means they have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, all carbon atoms have 6 protons. However, Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, while Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. They are both still carbon, but they have different masses. Isotopic notation is written as MassNumberSymbol, like C-14, or with the mass number as a superscript and atomic number as a subscript: ¹⁴₆C.

### **Sub-Unit 2.4: Calculating Average Atomic Mass**

If you look at the periodic table, you'll see that the mass for carbon is 12.011, not just 12 or 14\. This is because the **atomic mass** listed on the periodic table is a **weighted average** of the masses of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that element. The average is "weighted" according to the natural abundance of each isotope—the more common an isotope is, the more it contributes to the average.

Formula:  
Average Atomic Mass \= Σ (mass of isotope × relative abundance)  
**Example:** Chlorine has two main isotopes: Chlorine-35 (mass ≈ 34.969 amu, abundance \= 75.77%) and Chlorine-37 (mass ≈ 36.966 amu, abundance \= 24.23%).

1. Convert percentages to decimals: 75.77% → 0.7577; 24.23% → 0.2423.  
2. Multiply each isotope's mass by its abundance:  
   * (34.969 amu × 0.7577) \= 26.496 amu  
   * (36.966 amu × 0.2423) \= 8.957 amu  
3. Add the results:  
   * 26.496 amu \+ 8.957 amu \= **35.453 amu** (This matches the value on the periodic table\!)

### **Sub-Unit 2.5: Electron Configuration & Valence Electrons**

The **electron configuration** is the arrangement of electrons in an atom's orbitals. For Regents Chemistry, we use a simplified notation based on the Bohr model, showing the number of electrons in each principal energy level (shell).

* The 1st energy level can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.  
* The 2nd energy level can hold a maximum of 8 electrons.  
* The 3rd energy level can hold a maximum of 18 electrons.

For example, a sodium atom (Na) has 11 electrons. Its configuration is written as **2-8-1**. This means 2 electrons are in the first shell, 8 in the second, and 1 in the third.

The electrons in the outermost energy level are called **valence electrons**. They are the most important electrons in chemistry because they are the ones involved in chemical bonding. The number of valence electrons determines an element's chemical properties. For sodium (2-8-1), there is **1 valence electron**.

### **Sub-Unit 2.6: Ground State, Excited State & Bright-Line Spectra**

* **Ground State:** This is the lowest-energy, most stable arrangement of an atom's electrons. The electron configurations listed on the Periodic Table are ground state configurations.  
* **Excited State:** If an atom absorbs a specific amount of energy (from heat or electricity), one or more of its electrons can "jump" to a higher, empty energy level. This is an unstable, temporary condition. For example, a sodium atom (ground state 2-8-1) might absorb energy and become excited to a state of 2-7-2.

An excited electron cannot stay in the higher energy level for long. It quickly falls back down to a lower energy level. As it falls, it releases the energy it had absorbed in the form of light. The color of the light depends on the amount of energy released (how far the electron "fell").

Because electrons can only exist in specific energy levels, only specific amounts of energy can be released. This means that each element emits light only at specific frequencies, creating a unique **bright-line spectrum** (or emission spectrum). This spectrum is like a "fingerprint" or "barcode" for an element and can be used to identify it. This is how we know what stars are made of\!

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 2.1:** An interactive timeline. As students scroll, it shows each atomic model (Dalton's sphere, Thomson's plum pudding, etc.), with pop-ups explaining the key discovery and experiment that led to it.  
* **For 2.3:** An "Isotope Builder" simulation. Students can add or remove protons and neutrons from a nucleus. The interactive would update the element's name, atomic number, and mass number in real-time, helping them visualize the definition of an isotope.  
* **For 2.6:** A "Virtual Spectroscope." Students can select different elements (like Hydrogen, Helium, Neon), "energize" them with a virtual power source, and see the unique bright-line spectrum each one produces. They could then try to identify an "unknown" element by matching its spectrum.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Rutherford's gold foil experiment provided evidence that an atom:  
   (A) is a hard, indivisible sphere.  
   (B) consists of a positively charged "pudding" with electrons embedded in it.  
   (C) has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.  
   (D) has electrons in fixed planetary orbits.  
   (Answer: C)  
2. What is the total number of neutrons in an atom of ¹⁹₉F?  
   (A) 9  
   (B) 10  
   (C) 19  
   (D) 28  
   (Answer: B. Neutrons \= Mass Number \- Atomic Number \= 19 \- 9 \= 10\)

Short Answer:  
3\. An atom has an electron configuration of 2-8-5. Identify the element and state the number of valence electrons it has.  
(Answer: The total number of electrons is 2+8+5 \= 15\. The element with atomic number 15 is Phosphorus (P). It has 5 valence electrons (the electrons in the outermost shell).)

4. Explain, in terms of subatomic particles, why atoms of Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are both considered isotopes of carbon.  
   (Answer: They are isotopes because they both have the same number of protons (6 protons), which makes them carbon. However, they have different numbers of neutrons (C-12 has 6 neutrons, C-14 has 8 neutrons), giving them different mass numbers.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Element X has two natural isotopes. The isotope X-63 has a mass of 62.93 amu and a relative abundance of 69.17%. The isotope X-65 has a mass of 64.93 amu and a relative abundance of 30.83%. Calculate the average atomic mass of element X.  
(Answer:  
Contribution from X-63 \= 62.93 amu \* 0.6917 \= 43.529 amu  
Contribution from X-65 \= 64.93 amu \* 0.3083 \= 20.017 amu  
Average Atomic Mass \= 43.529 \+ 20.017 \= 63.546 amu. (This element is Copper, Cu))  
Application:  
6\. When a specific salt is heated in a flame, a vibrant green light is produced. Explain this phenomenon in terms of electron behavior, using the terms "ground state," "excited state," and "energy."  
(Answer: The atoms in the salt absorb energy from the flame. This causes their electrons to jump from their normal, low-energy 'ground state' to a higher-energy 'excited state.' This state is unstable, so the electrons immediately fall back down to the ground state. As they fall, they release the absorbed energy as light. The green color corresponds to the specific amount of energy released during this transition.)  
Extension:  
7\. The nucleus of a particular atom is sometimes called a "nuclide." A certain nuclide contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons. It undergoes a process where it emits an alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus, ⁴₂He). What is the atomic number and mass number of the new nuclide that is formed? Identify the new element.  
(Answer: The original nuclide is Uranium-235 (²³⁵₉₂U). Emitting an alpha particle (2 protons, 2 neutrons) reduces the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4\.  
New Atomic Number \= 92 \- 2 \= 90  
New Mass Number \= 235 \- 4 \= 231  
The element with atomic number 90 is Thorium (Th). The new nuclide is Thorium-231 (²³¹₉₀Th).)

#### **Real-World Connections**

The concepts of atomic structure have profound real-world applications. **Isotopes** are crucial in medicine; radioactive isotopes like Iodine-131 are used to treat thyroid cancer, while Carbon-14 dating allows archaeologists to determine the age of ancient artifacts. The unique **bright-line spectra** of elements are used by astronomers to determine the composition of distant stars and galaxies. And the very foundation of nuclear energy, both in power plants (**fission**) and in the sun (**fusion**), lies in the powerful forces holding the nucleus of the atom together.

### **Go Deeper: Quantum Numbers & Orbital Shapes**

While the Bohr model and simple electron shells (2-8-1) are useful, the modern wave-mechanical model provides a more detailed and accurate picture. It uses a set of four **quantum numbers** to give a complete "address" for every electron in an atom.

* **Principal Quantum Number (n):** This describes the main **energy level** or **shell** of the electron. It corresponds to the period number on the periodic table. (Values: n \= 1, 2, 3, ...)  
* **Angular Momentum Quantum Number (ℓ):** This describes the **sublevel** and the **shape** of the orbital within a shell. (Values: ℓ \= 0 to n-1)  
  * **ℓ \= 0** is an **s orbital**, which is spherical.  
  * **ℓ \= 1** is a **p orbital**, which has a dumbbell shape.  
  * **ℓ \= 2** is a **d orbital**, with more complex shapes.  
* **Magnetic Quantum Number (mℓ):** This describes the **orientation** of an orbital in 3D space. (Values: mℓ \= \-ℓ to \+ℓ)  
  * An s orbital (ℓ=0) has only one orientation (mℓ=0).  
  * A p orbital (ℓ=1) has three possible orientations (mℓ \= \-1, 0, \+1), corresponding to the px, py, and pz orbitals aligned along the x, y, and z axes.  
* **Spin Quantum Number (mₛ):** This describes the intrinsic spin of an electron, which can be thought of as either "spin up" or "spin down." (Values: mₛ \= \+½ or \-½). The **Pauli Exclusion Principle** states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers. This means that if two electrons are in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins.

**Orbital Shapes:**

* **s orbitals:** Are spherical. Every energy level (n=1, 2, 3, etc.) has one s orbital.  
* **p orbitals:** Are dumbbell-shaped and oriented along the x, y, and z axes. There are three p orbitals in each energy level starting from n=2.  
* **d orbitals:** Have more complex "cloverleaf" shapes. There are five d orbitals in each energy level starting from n=3.

The simple electron configurations we use are a summary of how electrons fill these specific orbitals according to rules like the Aufbau Principle. For example, the configuration for Sodium (2-8-1) is a simplification of the full configuration: **1s²2s²2p⁶3s¹**.
