### **Unit 10: Redox & Electrochemistry**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit delves into a major class of chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons: oxidation-reduction, or **redox**, reactions. You will learn to track this electron transfer by assigning oxidation numbers to atoms, allowing you to pinpoint exactly which substance loses electrons (oxidation) and which one gains them (reduction). We will then harness the power of these spontaneous redox reactions to create electricity in **voltaic (galvanic) cells**—the fundamental principle behind batteries. You'll learn to identify the key components of these cells, such as the anode and cathode, and describe the flow of electrons and ions. In the second part of the unit, we'll flip the process around. You will explore **electrolytic cells**, which use an external source of electricity to force non-spontaneous redox reactions to occur. This process, called electrolysis, is the basis for important industrial applications like electroplating and producing pure elements.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Define oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer (LEO says GER).  
* Assign oxidation numbers to atoms in compounds and ions to identify what is oxidized and reduced in a redox reaction.  
* Write and balance half-reactions for oxidation and reduction.  
* Identify the components of a voltaic cell (anode, cathode, salt bridge) and describe the direction of electron and ion flow.  
* Compare and contrast voltaic and electrolytic cells.  
* Describe the process of electrolysis and its applications, such as electroplating.

### **Sub-Unit 10.1: Oxidation & Reduction (LEO says GER)**

An **oxidation-reduction (redox)** reaction is any chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred from one substance to another.

* **Oxidation** is the **Loss** of **E**lectrons.  
* **Reduction** is the **Gain** of **E**lectrons.

A helpful mnemonic is **"LEO the lion says GER"** (Lose Electrons Oxidation, Gain Electrons Reduction) or **"OIL RIG"** (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain).

Oxidation and reduction are coupled processes; they must happen simultaneously. If one substance loses electrons, another substance must gain them.

* The substance that is oxidized is called the **reducing agent** (it causes the other substance to be reduced).  
* The substance that is reduced is called the **oxidizing agent** (it causes the other substance to be oxidized).

**Example:** Zn(s) \+ Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) \+ Cu(s)

* Zn starts as a neutral atom and becomes a Zn²⁺ ion. It **lost** 2 electrons, so it was **oxidized**. Zinc is the reducing agent.  
* Cu²⁺ starts as an ion and becomes a neutral Cu atom. It **gained** 2 electrons, so it was **reduced**. The copper(II) ion is the oxidizing agent.

### **Sub-Unit 10.2: Assigning Oxidation Numbers & Identifying Agents**

For covalent compounds where electrons are shared, not transferred, we use **oxidation numbers** (or oxidation states) to keep track of electron distribution. The oxidation number is the hypothetical charge an atom would have if all bonds were 100% ionic.

**Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers:**

1. The oxidation number of an atom in its elemental form is **0** (e.g., Fe, O₂, P₄).  
2. The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to its **charge** (e.g., Na⁺ is \+1, Cl⁻ is \-1).  
3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is **\-2** (except in peroxides like H₂O₂, where it is \-1).  
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is **\+1** when bonded to nonmetals and **\-1** when bonded to metals.  
5. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is **0**.  
6. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to the **ion's charge**.  
* **Oxidation** is identified as an **increase** in oxidation number.  
* **Reduction** is identified as a **decrease** in oxidation number.

### **Sub-Unit 10.3: Balancing Redox Reactions (Half-Reaction Method)**

A redox reaction can be broken down into two **half-reactions**: one for oxidation and one for reduction. This method helps us see the electron transfer clearly and is used to balance more complex redox equations.

**Example:** Zn(s) \+ Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) \+ Cu(s)

* Oxidation Half-Reaction: Shows the loss of electrons.  
  Zn → Zn²⁺ \+ 2e⁻  
* Reduction Half-Reaction: Shows the gain of electrons.  
  Cu²⁺ \+ 2e⁻ → Cu

Notice that the number of electrons lost in oxidation (2e⁻) equals the number of electrons gained in reduction (2e⁻). Mass and charge are conserved in each half-reaction.

### **Sub-Unit 10.4: Voltaic (Galvanic) Cells**

A **voltaic cell** (also called a galvanic cell) is an electrochemical cell that uses a **spontaneous** redox reaction to produce electrical energy. It converts chemical energy into electrical energy. A battery is a common example.

**Key Components:**

* **Two Half-Cells:** Each containing an electrode (a strip of metal) in a solution of its own ions.  
* **Anode:** The electrode where **oxidation** occurs. It is the more active metal. In a voltaic cell, the anode is the **negative** electrode. Mnemonic: **An Ox** (Anode \= Oxidation).  
* **Cathode:** The electrode where **reduction** occurs. It is the less active metal. In a voltaic cell, the cathode is the **positive** electrode. Mnemonic: **Red Cat** (Reduction \= Cathode).  
* **External Wire:** Allows electrons to flow from the **anode to the cathode**.  
* **Salt Bridge:** A tube containing a soluble salt that connects the two half-cells. It allows ions to flow between the cells to maintain charge neutrality, completing the circuit. Anions flow to the anode, and cations flow to the cathode.

As the cell operates, the anode corrodes (loses mass), and the cathode plates (gains mass).

### **Sub-Unit 10.5: Electrolytic Cells & Electroplating**

An **electrolytic cell** is an electrochemical cell that uses an **external source of electrical energy** (like a battery or power supply) to drive a **non-spontaneous** redox reaction. It converts electrical energy into chemical energy.

**Key Differences from Voltaic Cells:**

* **Energy:** Requires energy input; does not produce it.  
* **Reaction:** Forces a non-spontaneous reaction to occur.  
* **Electrode Polarity:** The external power source dictates the polarity. The **anode** (oxidation) is connected to the **positive** terminal, and the **cathode** (reduction) is connected to the **negative** terminal. (The An Ox / Red Cat rule still applies\!)

**Electrolysis** is the process of using electricity to bring about a chemical change. Common applications include:

* Breaking down compounds (e.g., electrolysis of water produces H₂ and O₂ gas).  
* Producing pure metals from their ores.  
* **Electroplating:** Depositing a thin layer of one metal onto another. The object to be plated is made the **cathode** of the electrolytic cell, and the plating metal is the **anode**.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 10.1 & 10.2:** An "Oxidation State Quizzer." The game presents a chemical formula (e.g., KMnO₄) and asks the student to identify the oxidation state of a specific element (e.g., Mn). It would provide feedback based on the oxidation rules.  
* **For 10.4:** A "Virtual Voltaic Cell Builder." Students can choose from different metal electrodes (Zn, Cu, Ag, Mg) and solutions to build a voltaic cell. The simulation would show the resulting voltage, the direction of electron flow, and an animation of the anode corroding and the cathode plating.  
* **For 10.5:** An "Electroplating Simulator." Students can set up a virtual electrolytic cell to plate a copper coating onto an iron key. They would need to correctly identify the anode, cathode, and solution, and connect the power supply correctly to make the process work.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. In the reaction Mg(s) \+ 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(aq) \+ H₂(g), the oxidation number of magnesium changes from:  
   (A) 0 to \+2  
   (B) \+2 to 0  
   (C) 0 to \-2  
   (D) \-2 to 0  
   (Answer: A)  
2. Which statement is true for all voltaic (galvanic) cells?  
   (A) Reduction occurs at the anode, which is positive.  
   (B) Reduction occurs at the cathode, which is positive.  
   (C) Oxidation occurs at the anode, which is positive.  
   (D) Oxidation occurs at the cathode, which is negative.  
   (Answer: B)

Short Answer:  
3\. Given the reaction: 2Fe³⁺(aq) \+ Sn²⁺(aq) → 2Fe²⁺(aq) \+ Sn⁴⁺(aq). Identify the substance that is oxidized and the substance that is reduced.  
(Answer: The oxidation state of Sn increases from \+2 to \+4, so Sn²⁺ is oxidized. The oxidation state of Fe decreases from \+3 to \+2, so Fe³⁺ is reduced.)

4. What is the purpose of the salt bridge in a voltaic cell?  
   (Answer: The salt bridge allows for the migration of ions between the two half-cells. This maintains electrical neutrality in each half-cell by balancing the charge buildup that occurs as the reaction proceeds, which completes the circuit and allows the cell to operate.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Write the balanced oxidation and reduction half-reactions for the following unbalanced redox reaction: Al(s) \+ Ag⁺(aq) → Al³⁺(aq) \+ Ag(s).  
(Answer:  
Oxidation: Al → Al³⁺ \+ 3e⁻  
Reduction: Ag⁺ \+ e⁻ → Ag. To balance electrons, it must be 3Ag⁺ \+ 3e⁻ → 3Ag.)  
Application:  
6\. A student wants to electroplate a silver coating onto a nickel ring.  
(a) Should the ring be the anode or the cathode?  
(b) What should the other electrode be made of?  
(c) What should the electrolyte solution contain?  
(Answer:  
(a) The ring should be the cathode, where reduction (plating) occurs.  
(b) The other electrode (the anode) should be made of pure silver (Ag).  
(c) The electrolyte solution should contain silver ions (e.g., silver nitrate, AgNO₃). )  
Extension:  
7\. Using Table J (Activity Series) in the NYS Reference Tables, predict whether a spontaneous reaction will occur if a strip of zinc metal is placed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄). Justify your answer.  
(Answer: Yes, a spontaneous reaction will occur. According to Table J, zinc (Zn) is listed above copper (Cu). This means zinc is more active and more easily oxidized than copper. Therefore, the zinc metal will spontaneously replace the copper ions in the solution, according to the reaction: Zn(s) \+ CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) \+ Cu(s).)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Redox reactions are happening all around us and inside us. **Corrosion**, like the rusting of a car, is a slow, spontaneous redox reaction. **Combustion**, the burning of fuels to power our cars and heat our homes, is a rapid redox reaction. **Batteries**, from the small ones in your remote control to the large one in your car, are all portable voltaic cells that use spontaneous redox reactions to generate electricity. **Metabolism**, the process by which our bodies get energy from food, is a complex series of redox reactions. **Electrolysis** is used industrially to produce essential chemicals like chlorine and pure metals like aluminum, and **electroplating** is used to put a shiny, protective chrome layer on car bumpers and a silver coating on fancy cutlery.

### **Go Deeper: Standard Cell Potential (E°cell)**

While the Activity Series (Table J) tells us *if* a reaction will be spontaneous, it doesn't tell us *how* spontaneous it is. The **standard cell potential (E°cell)** is a quantitative measure of the voltage a voltaic cell can produce under standard conditions (1 M concentrations, 1 atm pressure, 25°C).

Standard Reduction Potentials (E°):  
Tables of standard reduction potentials list the voltage produced by various reduction half-reactions compared to a standard hydrogen electrode (which is assigned a potential of 0.00 V).

* A **positive E°** value means the substance is easily reduced (it's a strong oxidizing agent).  
* A **negative E°** value means the substance is difficult to reduce and prefers to be oxidized (it's a strong reducing agent).

Calculating E°cell:  
To find the total voltage of a voltaic cell, we can combine the potentials of the two half-reactions. The overall reaction is the one where one substance is reduced and the other is oxidized.  
**Formula:** E°cell \= E°reduction (cathode) \- E°reduction (anode)

**Important Note:** The values in the table are all for *reduction*. For the substance that is oxidized at the anode, we still use its reduction potential from the table, but we subtract it. *Do not reverse the sign of the anode's potential in this formula.*

**Example:** Calculate the standard cell potential for a voltaic cell made of zinc and copper half-cells.

1. **Identify half-reactions and E° values from a standard table:**  
   * Reduction at Cathode: Cu²⁺ \+ 2e⁻ → Cu E° \= \+0.34 V  
   * Reduction at Anode: Zn²⁺ \+ 2e⁻ → Zn E° \= \-0.76 V  
   * (Since Zn is more easily oxidized, it will be the anode).  
2. Apply the formula:  
   E°cell \= E°cathode \- E°anode  
   E°cell \= (+0.34 V) \- (-0.76 V)  
   E°cell \= \+0.34 V \+ 0.76 V \= \+1.10 V

**Interpreting E°cell:**

* If **E°cell is positive**, the reaction is **spontaneous** as written and can be used in a voltaic cell.  
* If **E°cell is negative**, the reaction is **non-spontaneous** as written and would require energy input in an electrolytic cell to proceed.

This method provides a powerful way to predict not only the spontaneity of any redox reaction but also the voltage it can produce.
