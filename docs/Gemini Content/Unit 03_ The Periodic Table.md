### **Unit 03: The Periodic Table**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit unlocks the power of the most important tool in chemistry: the Periodic Table. You'll learn that it's far more than just a chart of elements; it's a predictive map of chemical behavior. We will explore its elegant structure, understanding the logic behind the arrangement of elements into periods (rows) and groups (columns). You'll learn to classify elements into three broad categories—metals, nonmetals, and metalloids—and see how their location on the table reveals their fundamental properties. The core of this unit is investigating the "periodic trends," the predictable patterns in properties like atomic size, ionization energy, and electronegativity that emerge as you move across or down the table. Finally, we'll zoom in on specific chemical families, like the highly reactive alkali metals and halogens, and the stable noble gases, to see how their shared properties are a direct result of their shared location on the table.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Describe the organization of the periodic table in terms of groups, periods, and atomic number.  
* Locate and describe the properties of metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.  
* Define and explain the periodic trends for atomic radius, ionic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity.  
* Predict an element's chemical properties based on its position in the periodic table.  
* Describe the characteristic properties of key elemental groups, including alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, and noble gases.

### **Sub-Unit 3.1: Structure & Organization of the Periodic Table**

The modern periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing **atomic number** (the number of protons). This arrangement reveals a fundamental principle known as the **Periodic Law**: when elements are arranged by atomic number, their physical and chemical properties show a periodic, or repeating, pattern.

The table is organized into a grid of vertical columns and horizontal rows:

* **Groups (or Families):** The 18 vertical columns. Elements within the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the **same number of valence electrons**. For example, all elements in Group 1 have one valence electron, which makes them all highly reactive metals.  
* **Periods:** The 7 horizontal rows. Elements in the same period have the **same number of occupied principal energy levels (electron shells)**. As you move from left to right across a period, properties change in a predictable way.

### **Sub-Unit 3.2: Classification of Elements (Metals, Nonmetals, Metalloids)**

The periodic table can be divided into three main classes of elements. A zig-zag line, or "staircase," on the right side of the table separates the metals from the nonmetals.

* **Metals:** Located on the **left side** of the staircase. The vast majority of elements are metals.  
  * **Properties:** Generally lustrous (shiny), solid at room temperature (except mercury), good conductors of heat and electricity, malleable (can be hammered into sheets), and ductile (can be drawn into wires). They tend to **lose electrons** to form positive ions (cations).  
* **Nonmetals:** Located on the **right side** of the staircase (plus hydrogen).  
  * **Properties:** Generally dull, brittle if solid, poor conductors of heat and electricity (insulators). They tend to **gain electrons** to form negative ions (anions) or share electrons in covalent bonds.  
* **Metalloids (or Semimetals):** Located **along the staircase**. These elements have properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals.  
  * **Properties:** They are "semiconductors," meaning they can conduct electricity under certain conditions. This property makes them essential for computer chips and electronics. The metalloids are B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, and Te.

### **Sub-Unit 3.3: Periodic Trends: Atomic Radius & Ionic Radius**

The location of an element on the periodic table allows us to predict its properties relative to other elements.

**Atomic Radius (Atom Size):**

* **Trend Down a Group:** Atomic radius **increases** as you go down a group. This is because each step down adds a new principal energy level (shell), placing the valence electrons further from the nucleus. This "shielding" effect from the inner electrons outweighs the pull of the increased number of protons.  
* **Trend Across a Period:** Atomic radius **decreases** as you go from left to right across a period. Although electrons are being added, they are going into the same energy level. At the same time, protons are being added to the nucleus, increasing the positive nuclear charge. This stronger pull draws the electron cloud in closer, making the atom smaller.

**Ionic Radius (Ion Size):**

* **Metals (Cations):** When a metal atom loses its valence electrons to form a positive ion (cation), it becomes **smaller** than the original atom. This is because it loses its entire outermost electron shell.  
* **Nonmetals (Anions):** When a nonmetal atom gains electrons to form a negative ion (anion), it becomes **larger** than the original atom. The added electrons increase the repulsion within the electron cloud, causing it to expand.

### **Sub-Unit 3.4: Periodic Trends: Ionization Energy & Electronegativity**

**First Ionization Energy (IE):** The amount of energy required to remove the most loosely held valence electron from a gaseous atom. It's a measure of how tightly an atom holds onto its electrons.

* **Trend Down a Group:** IE **decreases**. The valence electrons are farther from the nucleus and more shielded, making them easier to remove.  
* **Trend Across a Period:** IE **increases**. The increasing nuclear charge holds the electrons more tightly, so more energy is needed to remove one.

**Electronegativity (EN):** A measure of the ability of an atom's nucleus to attract the shared electrons in a chemical bond. The values range from 0 to 4.0 on the Pauling scale.

* **Trend Down a Group:** EN **decreases**. The increased distance and shielding from the nucleus make it harder to attract bonding electrons.  
* **Trend Across a Period:** EN **increases**. The increasing nuclear charge makes the atom better at attracting electrons.  
* **Note:** Noble gases are generally not assigned electronegativity values because they rarely form bonds. **Fluorine (F)** is the most electronegative element.

**Summary of Trends:**

| Trend | Across a Period (Left to Right) | Down a Group (Top to Bottom) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Atomic Radius** | Decreases | Increases |
| **Ionization Energy** | Increases | Decreases |
| **Electronegativity** | Increases | Decreases |
| **Metallic Character** | Decreases | Increases |

### **Sub-Unit 3.5: Properties of Groups**

Because they have the same number of valence electrons, elements in a group share distinct properties.

* **Group 1: Alkali Metals:** (Li, Na, K, etc.)  
  * Have 1 valence electron.  
  * Extremely reactive metals that lose their one valence electron to form \+1 ions.  
  * Reactivity increases down the group.  
  * So soft they can be cut with a knife; have low densities.  
* **Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals:** (Be, Mg, Ca, etc.)  
  * Have 2 valence electrons.  
  * Reactive metals (less so than Group 1\) that lose two electrons to form \+2 ions.  
* **Groups 3-12: Transition Metals:**  
  * Form colorful ions and solutions.  
  * Tend to be harder and denser than Group 1 & 2 metals.  
  * Can form ions with multiple different positive charges (e.g., Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺).  
* **Group 17: Halogens:** (F, Cl, Br, I)  
  * Have 7 valence electrons.  
  * Most reactive nonmetals; they gain one electron to form \-1 ions.  
  * Reactivity decreases down the group.  
  * Exist as diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, etc.).  
* **Group 18: Noble Gases:** (He, Ne, Ar, etc.)  
  * Have a full valence shell (8 electrons, except He which has 2).  
  * Extremely stable and unreactive (inert).  
  * Exist as single, unbonded atoms (monatomic).

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 3.1 & 3.2:** An "Interactive Periodic Table." When a student clicks on an element, a card pops up with its key data (symbol, atomic number, mass, electron configuration). The table could be color-coded, and students could filter it to highlight metals, nonmetals, metalloids, or specific groups.  
* **For 3.3 & 3.4:** A "Periodic Trends Visualizer." Students select a trend (e.g., atomic radius). The periodic table then displays each element as a sphere, with the size of the sphere representing the value of that property. Students can visually see atoms getting smaller across a period and larger down a group. Sliders could allow them to compare two elements directly.  
* **For 3.5:** "Alien Chemistry" game. Students are given fictional "alien" elements with specified numbers of valence electrons and must sort them into their correct chemical families (e.g., "This element has 1 valence electron, so it belongs with the 'Alkali Aliens'").

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Elements in the same period of the periodic table have the same:  
   (A) number of valence electrons.  
   (B) atomic radius.  
   (C) chemical properties.  
   (D) number of occupied electron shells.  
   (Answer: D)  
2. Which element has the highest electronegativity?  
   (A) Fluorine (F)  
   (B) Lithium (Li)  
   (C) Francium (Fr)  
   (D) Helium (He)  
   (Answer: A)

Short Answer:  
3\. Explain why a sodium atom (Na) is larger than a chlorine atom (Cl), even though chlorine has more electrons and protons.  
(Answer: Both sodium and chlorine are in Period 3, meaning they have the same number of electron shells. As you move from sodium to chlorine across the period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases. This stronger positive nuclear charge pulls the electron cloud in more tightly, making the chlorine atom smaller than the sodium atom.)

4. A calcium atom forms a Ca²⁺ ion. Does the ion have a larger or smaller radius than the original atom? Explain why.  
   (Answer: The Ca²⁺ ion is smaller than the Ca atom. The neutral calcium atom loses its two outermost valence electrons to become the ion. This results in the loss of its entire outer electron shell, making the resulting ion significantly smaller.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Consider the elements: Mg, Si, S, and Ba.  
(a) Arrange them in order of increasing atomic radius.  
(b) Arrange them in order of increasing first ionization energy.  
(Answer:  
(a) S \< Si \< Mg \< Ba. (Radius decreases across period 3, and Ba is much larger in period 6).  
(b) Ba \< Mg \< Si \< S. (IE increases across period 3, and Ba has a much lower IE in period 6). )  
Application:  
6\. An unknown element is a brittle solid that is a poor conductor of electricity. It is located in Group 16\. Predict the charge of the ion this element is most likely to form and whether it would have a high or low electronegativity.  
(Answer: As a brittle solid and poor conductor, it is a nonmetal. Elements in Group 16 have 6 valence electrons. To achieve a stable octet, it will most likely gain 2 electrons, forming an ion with a \-2 charge. As a nonmetal on the right side of the table, it would have a relatively high electronegativity.)  
Extension:  
7\. The first ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJ/mol, but the second ionization energy (the energy to remove a second electron) is 4562 kJ/mol, nearly ten times higher. Using your knowledge of electron configuration, explain this huge jump in energy.  
(Answer: Sodium's electron configuration is 2-8-1. The first ionization energy removes the single valence electron from the third shell. This is relatively easy. To remove a second electron, you must break into the now-full, stable second shell (octet). This requires a massive amount of energy because the electron is being removed from a stable, noble-gas-like configuration and is much closer to the nucleus.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

The periodic table is fundamental to creating new materials. Engineers use their knowledge of **metals** to build stronger, lighter alloys for airplanes and cars. The **metalloids**, especially silicon, are the heart of the digital revolution, forming the semiconductors in every computer and smartphone. Our health depends on periodic properties: we need **alkali and alkaline earth metals** like potassium and calcium as electrolytes for our nerves and bones. The reactivity of **halogens** like chlorine is harnessed to disinfect our drinking water and pools. And the inertness of **noble gases** like argon is used to create a protective atmosphere for welding and to fill incandescent light bulbs to prevent the filament from burning out.

### **Go Deeper: Electron Shielding & Trend Exceptions**

The general periodic trends provide a powerful framework, but understanding the "why" behind them—and their occasional exceptions—offers a deeper insight into atomic structure.

* **Electron Shielding:** The trend for atomic radius and ionization energy down a group is explained by **electron shielding**. As you go down a group, new electron shells are added between the nucleus and the valence electrons. These inner-shell electrons act as a "shield," partially blocking the positive pull of the nucleus from reaching the outer electrons. This shielding effect lessens the nucleus's grip on the valence electrons, making the atom larger and the valence electrons easier to remove (lower ionization energy). So, while the number of protons (nuclear charge) is increasing down a group, the shielding effect is more dominant, leading to the observed trends.  
* **Exceptions to Ionization Energy Trends:** While ionization energy generally increases across a period, there are small "dips" in the trend that reveal the stability of certain electron configurations.  
  * **Beryllium (Be) vs. Boron (B):** Beryllium (1s²2s²) has a higher first ionization energy than Boron (1s²2s²2p¹). This is unexpected because Boron is further to the right. The reason is that Beryllium's electron is being removed from a **full 2s sublevel**, which is a very stable configuration. Boron's electron is being removed from a lone **2p sublevel**, which is higher in energy and less stable. It's easier to remove that single p electron from Boron than it is to break into the stable, full s sublevel of Beryllium.  
  * **Nitrogen (N) vs. Oxygen (O):** Nitrogen (1s²2s²2p³) has a higher first ionization energy than Oxygen (1s²2s²2p⁴). Again, this is an exception to the general trend. The reason lies in the stability of a **half-filled p sublevel**. Nitrogen's three p electrons are in separate orbitals with parallel spins (Hund's Rule), a particularly stable arrangement. In Oxygen, the fourth p electron is forced to pair up in an orbital, which introduces electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion makes it slightly easier to remove that fourth electron from Oxygen than it is to remove an electron from the stable, half-filled p sublevel of Nitrogen.

These exceptions don't break the rules of chemistry; they reveal that the underlying principles of electron configuration and sublevel stability are what truly govern the properties we observe.
