### **Unit 01: Introduction to Chemistry & Measurement**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

Welcome to the amazing world of chemistry\! This foundational unit is your launchpad into understanding the matter that makes up everything around you, from the air you breathe to the phone in your hand. We'll start with the big picture: what chemistry is and how scientists use a special process called the scientific method to ask questions and find answers. Next, we'll gear up for the laboratory, learning the crucial rules of safety and getting familiar with the tools of the trade. You'll become an expert at classifying matter into different categories and learn to spot the difference between a simple physical change, like ice melting, and a complete chemical transformation, like a nail rusting. Finally, we'll dive into the language of science: measurement. You'll master the metric system, learn how to handle numbers like a scientist using significant figures, and figure out how to tell if your results are accurate and precise. By the end of this unit, you'll have the essential skills and vocabulary to explore the rest of chemistry with confidence.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Describe the scientific method and differentiate between observations, hypotheses, and theories.  
* Identify and apply laboratory safety rules and recognize common laboratory equipment.  
* Classify samples of matter as elements, compounds, homogeneous mixtures, or heterogeneous mixtures.  
* Distinguish between physical and chemical properties and changes.  
* Use the metric system (SI units) for scientific measurement and perform unit conversions using dimensional analysis.  
* Evaluate measurements for accuracy and precision, calculate percent error, and apply the rules of significant figures in calculations.

### **Sub-Unit 1.1: The Scope of Chemistry & The Scientific Method**

Chemistry is often called the "central science" because it connects to virtually every other field of science, from biology and medicine to physics and environmental science. At its core, chemistry is the study of **matter**—what it's made of, what its properties are, and how it changes. Every object in the universe, from a star to a speck of dust, is made of matter. Chemists explore the tiny particles called atoms and molecules that are the fundamental building blocks of this matter. They study how these particles are arranged and how they interact with each other to form the incredible variety of substances we see every day.

To do this, scientists use a logical, systematic approach called the **scientific method**. This isn't a rigid, step-by-step recipe but a flexible process for inquiry.

1. **Observation:** It all starts with noticing something. An observation is information gathered using your senses or scientific instruments. It can be **qualitative** (descriptive, like "the liquid is blue") or **quantitative** (involving numbers, like "the liquid has a volume of 50.2 mL").  
2. **Hypothesis:** Based on observations, a scientist proposes a **hypothesis**—a testable, tentative explanation or prediction. A good hypothesis is a statement, not a question, such as, "If salt is added to water, then the boiling point will increase."  
3. **Experimentation:** Scientists design controlled experiments to test the hypothesis. A good experiment changes only one variable at a time (the **independent variable**) and measures the effect on another variable (the **dependent variable**), while keeping all other conditions (**constants**) the same.  
4. **Analysis & Conclusion:** After collecting and analyzing data from the experiment, the scientist draws a conclusion. Does the evidence support or refute the hypothesis? If it's refuted, it's time to form a new hypothesis and test again.  
5. **Theory & Law:** If a hypothesis is supported by a large body of evidence from many experiments, it may become a **theory**—a well-substantiated, comprehensive explanation for why things in nature happen (e.g., Atomic Theory). A **scientific law**, on the other hand, is a statement that summarizes an observed phenomenon but does not explain it (e.g., the Law of Conservation of Mass).

### **Sub-Unit 1.2: Lab Safety, Symbols & Equipment**

The chemistry lab is an exciting place for discovery, but safety is the number one priority. Following safety rules protects you and everyone around you. The most important rule is to **always wear safety goggles** to protect your eyes from chemical splashes or broken glass. Other key rules include: never eat or drink in the lab, tie back long hair, wear closed-toe shoes, and never perform unauthorized experiments. Always know the location of safety equipment like the fire extinguisher, safety shower, and eyewash station.

You'll also encounter various safety symbols (**WHMIS** \- Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System) that warn you about potential dangers, such as materials that are flammable, corrosive, or toxic.

To work effectively, you need to know your tools. Here's some common lab equipment:

* **Beaker:** A wide-mouthed cylindrical container used for mixing, stirring, and heating chemicals. Its volume markings are approximate.  
* **Graduated Cylinder:** A tall, cylindrical container used to measure precise volumes of liquids. You read the volume from the bottom of the curved surface, called the **meniscus**.  
* **Erlenmeyer Flask:** A cone-shaped flask that's good for swirling liquids without splashing.  
* **Test Tube:** A small glass tube used to hold and mix small amounts of substances.  
* **Balance (Electronic or Triple-Beam):** Used to measure mass accurately.  
* **Bunsen Burner:** A gas burner used for heating.  
* **Pipette and Buret:** Used to deliver very precise and variable volumes of liquid, often used in titrations.  
* **Funnel:** Used to transfer liquids or fine-grained solids into containers with small openings.

### **Sub-Unit 1.3: Classification of Matter**

All matter can be classified into two main categories: **pure substances** and **mixtures**.

A **pure substance** has a uniform and definite composition. This means it's the same all the way through, and it has a fixed chemical formula. Pure substances can be further divided into:

* **Elements:** The simplest form of matter, made of only one type of atom. They cannot be broken down by chemical means. Examples: Oxygen (O), Iron (Fe), Helium (He).  
* **Compounds:** Formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. They can be broken down into simpler elements, but only through a chemical reaction. The properties of a compound are unique and different from its constituent elements. Example: Water (H₂O) is made of hydrogen and oxygen, but its properties are nothing like the two gases.

A **mixture** is a physical blend of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. Each substance in the mixture keeps its own identity and properties. Mixtures have variable compositions. There are two types of mixtures:

* **Homogeneous Mixture:** The composition is uniform throughout; you cannot see the individual components. It looks like a single substance. These are also called **solutions**. Examples: Saltwater, air, brass (a metal alloy).  
* **Heterogeneous Mixture:** The composition is not uniform. You can see the different parts. Examples: Sand and water, a chocolate chip cookie, oil and vinegar salad dressing.

Mixtures can be separated back into their components using physical methods that take advantage of differences in physical properties. Common separation techniques include:

* **Filtration:** Separating a solid from a liquid using a filter (e.g., sand from water).  
* **Evaporation:** Separating a dissolved solid from a liquid by boiling the liquid away (e.g., salt from water).  
* **Distillation:** Separating two liquids with different boiling points.  
* **Chromatography:** Separating components of a mixture (like ink) based on how they move through a special material.

### **Sub-Unit 1.4: Physical vs. Chemical Properties & Changes**

Every substance has a unique set of properties that we can use to identify it. These properties fall into two categories.

A **physical property** is a quality or condition of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the substance's composition. Examples include:

* Color, odor, texture  
* Melting point, boiling point  
* Density (mass per unit volume)  
* Solubility (ability to dissolve)  
* Malleability (ability to be hammered into sheets)  
* Conductivity (ability to conduct heat or electricity)

A **physical change** is a change that alters a substance's appearance but not its chemical makeup. No new substance is formed. Examples include:

* Changes of state (melting, freezing, boiling, condensing)  
* Tearing paper, crushing a can  
* Dissolving sugar in water

A **chemical property** describes the ability of a substance to undergo a specific chemical change and form new substances. You can only observe a chemical property during a chemical reaction. Examples include:

* Flammability (ability to burn)  
* Reactivity with acid  
* Ability to rust (oxidize)

A **chemical change**, or **chemical reaction**, is a process where one or more substances are converted into one or more new substances with different properties. Evidence that a chemical change has occurred often includes:

* Production of a gas (bubbling)  
* Formation of a precipitate (a solid that forms from a solution)  
* A permanent color change  
* Transfer of energy (production of light or a change in temperature)  
  Examples include burning wood, baking a cake, or iron rusting.

### **Sub-Unit 1.5: The Metric System (SI Units) & Dimensional Analysis**

In science, we use a standard system of measurement called the **International System of Units (SI)**, which is a modern form of the metric system. Using a single system allows scientists everywhere to communicate their results without confusion.

| Quantity | Base Unit | Symbol |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Length | meter | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Temperature | Kelvin | K |
| Amount | mole | mol |
| Volume | liter | L |

The metric system uses prefixes to represent multiples or fractions of the base units. These prefixes are based on powers of 10\. You should know these common prefixes:

* **kilo- (k):** 1,000 (1 km \= 1000 m)  
* **deci- (d):** 0.1 (1 m \= 10 dm)  
* **centi- (c):** 0.01 (1 m \= 100 cm)  
* **milli- (m):** 0.001 (1 m \= 1000 mm)  
* **micro- (µ):** 0.000001 (1 m \= 1,000,000 µm)

To convert between units, we use a problem-solving method called **dimensional analysis** (or the factor-label method). This involves multiplying by **conversion factors**—fractions that are equal to 1 because the numerator and denominator are equivalent (e.g., 1000 m / 1 km or 1 km / 1000 m).

**Example:** Convert 2.5 kilometers (km) to centimeters (cm).

1. **Start with what you're given:** 2.5 km  
2. Convert km to m: Multiply by the conversion factor that cancels km.  
   2.5 km \* (1000 m / 1 km) \= 2500 m  
3. Convert m to cm: Multiply by the conversion factor that cancels m.  
   2500 m \* (100 cm / 1 m) \= 250,000 cm  
   The units km and m cancel out, leaving the desired unit, cm.

### **Sub-Unit 1.6: Accuracy, Precision, Percent Error & Significant Figures**

In science, there's a big difference between being accurate and being precise.

* **Accuracy:** How close a measurement is to the true or accepted value.  
* Precision: How close a series of measurements are to one another.  
  You can be precise without being accurate (e.g., hitting the same spot on a dartboard every time, but it's far from the bullseye). The goal in the lab is to be both accurate and precise.

To quantify the accuracy of a measurement, we often calculate the percent error:  
Percent Error \= (| Measured Value \- Accepted Value | / Accepted Value) \* 100%  
The vertical bars mean "absolute value," so the result is always positive.  
Every measurement has some uncertainty. Significant figures (or "sig figs") in a measurement include all the digits that are known with certainty plus one last digit that is estimated. They communicate the precision of our measurements.  
Rules for Counting Significant Figures:

1. Non-zero digits are always significant. (e.g., 24.7 has 3 sig figs)  
2. Zeros between non-zero digits are significant. (e.g., 7003 has 4 sig figs)  
3. Leading zeros (zeros at the beginning) are not significant. (e.g., 0.008 has 1 sig fig)  
4. Trailing zeros (zeros at the end) are significant only if there is a decimal point. (e.g., 100\. has 3 sig figs, 100 has 1 sig fig, 0.2500 has 4 sig figs)

**Rules for Calculations:**

* **Multiplication/Division:** The answer must have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the *fewest* significant figures.  
* **Addition/Subtraction:** The answer must have the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the *fewest* decimal places.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 1.2:** A "Virtual Lab Equipment" interactive where students click on different pieces of equipment (beaker, graduated cylinder, Bunsen burner) to learn their names and uses. Include a drag-and-drop quiz to match equipment to its function.  
* **For 1.3:** An interactive "Mixture Separation Challenge." Present students with a virtual heterogeneous mixture (e.g., iron filings, sand, and salt in water) and a set of tools (magnet, filter paper, funnel, hot plate). They must choose the correct tools and steps to separate the components.  
* **For 1.6:** A "Significant Figure Calculator" game. The tool presents random numbers and calculations, and the student must input the answer with the correct number of significant figures. It would provide immediate feedback on their answers.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. A student observes that a solution fizzes when a white powder is added. This observation is best described as:  
   (A) An inference  
   (B) A qualitative observation  
   (C) A quantitative observation  
   (D) A scientific theory  
   (Answer: B)  
2. Which of the following is a chemical property of iron?  
   (A) Iron is a solid at room temperature.  
   (B) Iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm³.  
   (C) Iron conducts electricity.  
   (D) Iron rusts in the presence of air and water.  
   (Answer: D)

Short Answer:  
3\. Explain the difference between an element and a compound at the atomic level.  
(Answer: An element is made of only one type of atom (e.g., all atoms are copper). A compound is made of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio (e.g., H₂O molecules, each containing 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom). )

4. A student measures the boiling point of water to be 98.6 °C. The accepted boiling point is 100.0 °C. Calculate the student's percent error.  
   (Answer: Percent Error \= (|98.6 \- 100.0| / 100.0) \* 100% \= (1.4 / 100.0) \* 100% \= 1.4%)

Problem Solving:  
5\. A rectangular block of wood has dimensions of 2.0 cm, 5.5 cm, and 10.0 cm. It has a mass of 82.5 g.  
(a) Calculate the volume of the block.  
(b) Calculate the density of the block. Remember to use the correct number of significant figures in your final answers.  
(Answer:  
(a) Volume \= 2.0 cm \* 5.5 cm \* 10.0 cm \= 110 cm³. (2 sig figs from 2.0)  
(b) Density \= mass/volume \= 82.5 g / 110 cm³ \= 0.75 g/cm³. (2 sig figs)  
)  
Application:  
6\. You are given a mixture of small plastic beads and sand. Describe a step-by-step procedure you could use to separate these two substances, explaining the physical property that allows the separation to work.  
(Answer: Add the mixture to a beaker of water. The sand will sink because its density is greater than water, while the plastic beads will float because their density is less than water. The beads can then be skimmed off the surface. This separation works because of the difference in density between the three substances.)  
Extension:  
7\. The density of gold is 19.3 g/cm³. A person claiming to have a pure gold nugget says it has a mass of 95.0 g and a volume of 5.5 cm³. Is the nugget likely pure gold? Justify your answer with a calculation.  
(Answer: Calculate the density of the nugget: Density \= 95.0 g / 5.5 cm³ ≈ 17.3 g/cm³. This calculated density is significantly lower than the accepted density of gold (19.3 g/cm³). Therefore, the nugget is not likely pure gold.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

The concepts in this unit are everywhere. **Lab safety** is the foundation not just for chemists, but for doctors, nurses, and chefs. **Classifying matter** is what recycling centers do every day, separating materials based on their physical properties. Understanding the difference between **physical and chemical changes** helps you understand cooking—boiling water is a physical change, but toasting bread is a chemical one. Every time you read a nutrition label, you're looking at measurements of mass (grams) and volume (milliliters). And **accuracy and precision** are vital in fields from pharmacology, where a tiny error in a drug's dosage can have huge effects, to engineering, where precise measurements are needed to build a stable bridge.

### **Go Deeper: Understanding Experimental Error**

Beyond just calculating percent error, it's crucial to understand the *types* of errors that can occur in an experiment. This helps scientists design better experiments and have more confidence in their conclusions.

* **Systematic Error:** This is a consistent, repeatable error that is often caused by a flaw in the experimental setup or a miscalibrated instrument. It affects the accuracy of the results, causing them to be consistently too high or too low.  
  * **Example:** A digital balance that was not zeroed properly and always measures mass as 0.2 g higher than it actually is. No matter how many times you measure, your results will always be off by that same amount. This error cannot be fixed by averaging multiple trials.  
* **Random Error:** This is an error caused by unpredictable and uncontrollable fluctuations in the measurement process. It affects the precision of the results, causing them to be scattered around an average value.  
  * **Example:** When reading a graduated cylinder, you might estimate the volume slightly differently each time due to variations in your eye level. Air currents causing a digital balance to flicker are another source of random error. This type of error *can* be minimized by taking many measurements and calculating an average.  
* **Basic Statistical Analysis:** To analyze a set of measurements affected by random error, scientists use basic statistics:  
  * **Mean (Average):** The sum of all measurements divided by the number of measurements. This gives the best central estimate.  
  * **Median:** The middle value when the measurements are arranged in order. This is less affected by a single outlier than the mean.  
  * **Example Data Set (mass in g):** {5.12, 5.15, 5.11, 5.45, 5.13}  
    * **Mean:** (5.12 \+ 5.15 \+ 5.11 \+ 5.45 \+ 5.13) / 5 \= **5.19 g**  
    * **Median:** First, order the data: {5.11, 5.12, **5.13**, 5.15, 5.45}. The middle value is **5.13 g**.  
    * Notice the outlier (5.45 g) pulled the mean higher, but the median was unaffected. This demonstrates how different statistical tools can give a more complete picture of the data.
