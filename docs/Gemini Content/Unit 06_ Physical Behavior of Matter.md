### **Unit 06: Physical Behavior of Matter**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit explores the physical states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas—and the principles that govern their behavior. We'll begin with the Kinetic Molecular Theory, a powerful model that explains the properties of matter by imagining it as a collection of tiny, constantly moving particles. You will learn to interpret heating and cooling curves, which graphically show what happens to temperature and energy as a substance changes phase, for example, from ice to water to steam. We will investigate the concepts of vapor pressure and boiling point, understanding how they are related and influenced by intermolecular forces. The majority of the unit will focus on the behavior of gases. You'll explore the relationships between a gas's pressure, volume, and temperature, and learn to use the Gas Laws (Boyle's, Charles's, and the Combined Gas Law) to calculate how a gas will respond to changing conditions. Finally, we'll compare the behavior of ideal gases (a theoretical model) to real gases, learning when and why they differ.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Use the Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) to explain the properties of solids, liquids, and gases.  
* Analyze heating and cooling curves to identify phase changes and calculate energy absorbed or released.  
* Define vapor pressure and explain its relationship to boiling point and temperature.  
* Apply the Gas Laws (Boyle's, Charles's, and the Combined Gas Law) to solve problems involving the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas.  
* Distinguish between the behavior of ideal gases and real gases.

### **Sub-Unit 6.1: States of Matter & The Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)**

The **Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)** explains the behavior of matter based on the idea that all matter is composed of tiny particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) that are in constant, random motion. The energy of this motion (kinetic energy) is proportional to the temperature in Kelvin.

* **Solids:** Particles are packed tightly in a fixed, orderly arrangement (a crystal lattice). They vibrate in place but do not move past one another. Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.  
* **Liquids:** Particles are close together but are free to move past one another. The attractive forces between particles are strong enough to give liquids a definite volume, but not strong enough to give them a definite shape (they take the shape of their container).  
* **Gases:** Particles are far apart and move rapidly and randomly. The attractive forces between particles are negligible. Gases have no definite shape and no definite volume (they expand to fill their container).

### **Sub-Unit 6.2: Phase Changes & Heating/Cooling Curves**

A **phase change** is a transition of matter from one state to another. These changes are physical changes that occur when energy is either absorbed or released.

* **Endothermic** (Energy Absorbed): Melting (solid → liquid), Boiling/Evaporation (liquid → gas), Sublimation (solid → gas).  
* **Exothermic** (Energy Released): Freezing (liquid → solid), Condensation (gas → liquid), Deposition (gas → solid).

A **heating curve** is a graph of temperature versus heat added.

* **Sloped Sections:** The temperature of a single phase (solid, liquid, or gas) is increasing. Kinetic energy is increasing. Heat can be calculated using q \= mCΔT.  
* **Flat Plateaus:** A phase change is occurring at a constant temperature (e.g., the melting point or boiling point). The absorbed energy is increasing the potential energy of the particles, allowing them to overcome intermolecular forces, rather than increasing their kinetic energy. Heat can be calculated using q \= mHfus (for melting) or q \= mHvap (for boiling).

A **cooling curve** is the opposite, showing temperature versus heat removed, with plateaus for condensation and freezing.

### **Sub-Unit 6.3: Vapor Pressure & Boiling Point**

**Evaporation** is the process where molecules at the surface of a liquid escape into the gas phase. In a closed container, these gas particles create pressure above the liquid.

* **Vapor Pressure:** The pressure exerted by the vapor (gas) above its liquid in a closed system at equilibrium.  
* **Effect of Temperature:** As temperature increases, more molecules have enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid, so the **vapor pressure increases**.  
* **Effect of IMFs:** Liquids with weak intermolecular forces (like acetone) are **volatile**—they evaporate easily and have a **high vapor pressure**. Liquids with strong IMFs (like water) have a **low vapor pressure**.  
* **Boiling Point:** The temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the external (atmospheric) pressure. At this point, bubbles of vapor can form throughout the liquid and rise to the surface.  
* **Normal Boiling Point:** The boiling point of a liquid at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 101.3 kPa). The normal boiling point of water is 100 °C.  
* At high altitudes, where atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature.

### **Sub-Unit 6.4: The Gas Laws (Boyle's, Charles's, Gay-Lussac's)**

The behavior of gases can be described by a set of laws that relate pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T). **Important:** Temperature must always be in **Kelvin (K)** for gas law calculations\! K \= °C \+ 273\.

* **Boyle's Law (P and V):** At constant temperature, the pressure and volume of a gas are **inversely proportional**. As pressure increases, volume decreases.  
  * Formula: P₁V₁ \= P₂V₂  
* **Charles's Law (V and T):** At constant pressure, the volume and absolute temperature (Kelvin) of a gas are **directly proportional**. As temperature increases, volume increases.  
  * Formula: V₁/T₁ \= V₂/T₂  
* **Gay-Lussac's Law (P and T):** At constant volume, the pressure and absolute temperature (Kelvin) of a gas are **directly proportional**. As temperature increases, pressure increases.  
  * Formula: P₁/T₁ \= P₂/T₂

### **Sub-Unit 6.5: The Combined Gas Law & Ideal vs. Real Gases**

The **Combined Gas Law** merges Boyle's, Charles's, and Gay-Lussac's laws into a single, more versatile equation for a fixed amount of gas.

* Formula: (P₁V₁) / T₁ \= (P₂V₂) / T₂  
  * You can cover up the variable that is held constant to get the other laws.

**Ideal Gas:** An **ideal gas** is a theoretical gas that perfectly follows all the gas laws under all conditions. It is based on two key assumptions of the KMT that are not entirely true for real gases:

1. Gas particles themselves have no volume (they are just points in space).  
2. There are no attractive or repulsive forces between gas particles.

**Real Gas:** A **real gas** is an actual gas (like O₂, H₂, etc.). Its behavior deviates from the ideal gas model.

* Real gases behave **most like ideal gases** at **high temperatures** and **low pressures**. Under these conditions, the particles are far apart and moving fast, so their own volume and their attractive forces become insignificant.  
* Real gases deviate **most from ideal behavior** at **low temperatures** and **high pressures**. Under these conditions, the particles are close together, so their own volume becomes significant and their attractive forces can cause them to condense into a liquid. Gases with strong IMFs (like H₂O) or large molecules deviate more than gases with weak IMFs (like He).

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 6.1:** A "KMT Simulator" where students can select solid, liquid, or gas and see a visual representation of the particles' motion, spacing, and energy. Sliders for temperature could change the particle speed.  
* **For 6.2:** An interactive "Heating Curve." Students drag a substance (e.g., ice) onto a virtual heater. The graph of temperature vs. time is plotted in real-time. The simulation pauses at the melting and boiling points, with pop-ups explaining what is happening at the molecular level during the phase change.  
* **For 6.4 & 6.5:** A "Gas Law Lab" simulation. Students can manipulate the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas in a virtual container and see the immediate effects on the other variables. They could be challenged to achieve a target state by adjusting the controls, reinforcing the P-V-T relationships.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Which statement correctly describes the particles of a gas according to the Kinetic Molecular Theory?  
   (A) They are strongly attracted to each other and are in fixed positions.  
   (B) They are in constant, random, straight-line motion.  
   (C) They have a definite volume but no definite shape.  
   (D) They have strong intermolecular forces and move slowly.  
   (Answer: B)  
2. A sample of gas is in a sealed, rigid container. If the temperature of the gas is increased, the pressure inside the container will:  
   (A) increase.  
   (B) decrease.  
   (C) remain the same.  
   (Answer: A)

Short Answer:  
3\. Explain why the temperature of water remains constant at 100°C while it is boiling, even though heat is continuously being added.  
(Answer: During a phase change like boiling, the added heat energy (potential energy) is used to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the liquid molecules together, rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature) of the molecules. Once all the liquid has turned to gas, the temperature of the gas can then increase.)

4. A real gas behaves most like an ideal gas under which two conditions? Explain why.  
   (Answer: High temperature and low pressure. At high temperatures, particles move too fast for their weak attractive forces to have an effect. At low pressures, the particles are very far apart, so their individual volume is negligible compared to the total volume of the container.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. A balloon contains 1.5 L of air at 25 °C. If the balloon is placed in a freezer where the temperature is \-10 °C, what will the new volume of the balloon be (assuming constant pressure)?  
(Answer: First, convert temperatures to Kelvin: T₁ \= 25 \+ 273 \= 298 K; T₂ \= \-10 \+ 273 \= 263 K. Use Charles's Law: V₁/T₁ \= V₂/T₂. (1.5 L / 298 K) \= V₂ / 263 K. V₂ \= (1.5 L × 263 K) / 298 K \= 1.3 L.)  
Application:  
6\. A can of spray paint has a warning label that says, "Do not store above 120 °F (49 °C). Do not incinerate." Use the gas laws to explain the danger of heating the can.  
(Answer: A spray can has a fixed volume. According to Gay-Lussac's Law, at constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. Heating the can increases the temperature of the gas inside, which causes a drastic increase in pressure. This can cause the can to explode.)  
Extension:  
7\. The normal boiling point of ethanol is 78 °C, and the normal boiling point of water is 100 °C. Which substance has the higher vapor pressure at 78 °C? Explain your answer in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: At 78 °C, ethanol has the higher vapor pressure. The boiling point is when vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. Since ethanol boils at 78 °C, its vapor pressure must be 1 atm at that temperature. Water, which doesn't boil until 100 °C, will have a vapor pressure lower than 1 atm at 78 °C. This is because water has stronger intermolecular forces (specifically, stronger hydrogen bonding) than ethanol, making it less volatile and giving it a lower vapor pressure at any given temperature below its boiling point.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

The principles of physical matter are at play all around us. The **KMT and Gas Laws** explain why a car tire's pressure increases on a hot day and why a hot air balloon rises. **Vapor pressure** is why you feel colder after getting out of a pool—the evaporating water takes heat from your skin. Understanding **phase changes** is critical for industries from food preservation (freeze-drying) to metallurgy (casting molten metals). And the difference between **ideal and real gases** is crucial for engineers who handle gases under high pressure, like in scuba tanks or natural gas pipelines, where ideal gas assumptions would be dangerously inaccurate.

### **Go Deeper: The Ideal Gas Law & Dalton's Law**

While the Combined Gas Law is perfect for comparing a gas under two different sets of conditions, it can't solve for the amount (moles) of gas. For that, we use the **Ideal Gas Law**.

The Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT)  
This powerful equation relates all four gas variables—pressure (P), volume (V), number of moles (n), and temperature (T)—at a single point in time.

* **Formula:** PV \= nRT  
  * P \= Pressure (must be in atm or kPa)  
  * V \= Volume (must be in Liters)  
  * n \= number of moles of gas  
  * T \= Temperature (must be in Kelvin)  
  * R \= The Ideal Gas Constant. The value of R depends on the pressure unit used:  
    * R \= 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K  
    * R \= 8.314 L·kPa/mol·K

**Example:** What is the volume occupied by 2.00 moles of nitrogen gas at 25 °C and 1.20 atm?

1. **Identify variables:**  
   * P \= 1.20 atm  
   * n \= 2.00 mol  
   * T \= 25 °C \+ 273 \= 298 K  
   * R \= 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K (use this one to match the pressure unit)  
2. **Rearrange and solve for V:** V \= nRT / P  
   * V \= (2.00 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(298 K) / 1.20 atm  
   * V \= 40.8 L

Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures  
This law applies to mixtures of gases. It states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas in the mixture.

* **Formula:** P\_total \= P\_gas1 \+ P\_gas2 \+ P\_gas3 \+ ...  
* **Partial Pressure (P\_gas):** The pressure that a single gas in the mixture would exert if it were the only gas in the container.

Application: Collecting Gas Over Water  
When a gas is collected by bubbling it through water, the collected gas is not pure; it is a mixture of the gas and water vapor. The total pressure inside the collection tube is equal to the atmospheric pressure outside.  
P\_atm \= P\_gas \+ P\_H₂O  
To find the pressure of just the dry gas you collected, you must subtract the vapor pressure of water at that specific temperature (which you would look up in a table).
