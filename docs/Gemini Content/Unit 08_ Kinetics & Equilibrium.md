### **Unit 08: Kinetics & Equilibrium**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit answers two fundamental questions about chemical reactions: How fast do they go, and how far do they go? The first part, **kinetics**, explores the factors that control the speed, or rate, of a reaction. Using the Collision Theory, you'll learn that reactions happen when particles collide with the right amount of energy and the correct orientation. We will investigate how changing conditions like temperature, concentration, and surface area can speed up or slow down a reaction, and we will explore the role of catalysts in providing a faster pathway. The second part of the unit introduces **chemical equilibrium**, the state of balance in reversible reactions where the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. You will learn to recognize this dynamic state and use the powerful Le Châtelier's Principle to predict how a system at equilibrium will respond, or "shift," to relieve stresses like changes in concentration, pressure, or temperature.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Use Collision Theory to explain how chemical reactions occur.  
* Describe the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction (temperature, concentration, surface area, nature of reactants, and catalysts).  
* Interpret potential energy diagrams to determine activation energy, heat of reaction (ΔH), and the effect of a catalyst.  
* Define chemical equilibrium as a dynamic state where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.  
* Apply Le Châtelier's Principle to predict the direction of shift in an equilibrium system when conditions are changed.

### **Sub-Unit 8.1: Collision Theory & Factors Affecting Reaction Rates**

**Collision Theory** states that for a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with each other. However, not all collisions result in a reaction. An **effective collision** requires two things:

1. **Sufficient Energy:** The colliding particles must have at least a minimum amount of kinetic energy, known as the **activation energy (Ea)**.  
2. **Correct Orientation:** The particles must collide in the proper orientation to allow existing bonds to break and new bonds to form.

The **reaction rate** is a measure of how quickly reactants are converted into products. We can change the reaction rate by altering factors that affect the frequency or effectiveness of collisions.

**Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:**

* **Temperature:** Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles. This leads to more frequent collisions and, more importantly, a higher percentage of collisions having enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. **Higher temperature \= Faster rate.**  
* **Concentration:** Increasing the concentration of reactants means there are more particles packed into a given volume. This leads to more frequent collisions. **Higher concentration \= Faster rate.**  
* **Surface Area:** For reactions involving a solid, increasing the surface area (e.g., by crushing a solid chunk into a powder) exposes more particles to the other reactant. This increases the frequency of effective collisions. **Greater surface area \= Faster rate.**  
* **Pressure (for gases):** Increasing the pressure of a gaseous system is equivalent to increasing its concentration (it forces the gas particles closer together). This leads to more frequent collisions. **Higher pressure \= Faster rate.**  
* **Nature of Reactants:** Reactions involving ionic substances in aqueous solution are often very fast because the ions are free to move and collide. Reactions involving the breaking of strong covalent bonds are often slower.  
* **Catalyst:** A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction **without being consumed** in the process.

### **Sub-Unit 8.2: Potential Energy Diagrams & Catalysts**

A **potential energy (PE) diagram** plots the change in potential energy as reactants are converted to products.

* **Heat of Reaction (ΔH):** The difference between the potential energy of the products and the potential energy of the reactants (ΔH \= PE\_products \- PE\_reactants).  
  * In an **exothermic** reaction, products have lower PE than reactants, so **ΔH is negative**.  
  * In an **endothermic** reaction, products have higher PE than reactants, so **ΔH is positive**.  
* **Activation Energy (Ea):** The minimum energy required to start the reaction. It is the energy difference between the reactants and the **activated complex** (the peak of the energy "hill"). The activated complex is an unstable, high-energy transition state.

Role of a Catalyst:  
A catalyst speeds up a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway, or mechanism, with a lower activation energy. It does not change the potential energy of the reactants or products, and therefore it does not change the ΔH of the reaction. With a lower energy hill to climb, more collisions are effective, and the reaction rate increases for both the forward and reverse reactions.

### **Sub-Unit 8.3: The Nature of Chemical Equilibrium**

Many chemical reactions are **reversible**, meaning they can proceed in both the forward (reactants → products) and reverse (products → reactants) directions. This is indicated by a double arrow (⇌).

**Chemical equilibrium** is the state reached when the **rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction**.

* It is a **dynamic** state: both reactions are still occurring, but there is no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products.  
* At equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products become **constant** (but they are rarely equal).  
* Equilibrium can only be established in a **closed system**, where no substances can enter or leave.

Examples include phase equilibrium (e.g., evaporation and condensation in a sealed water bottle) and solution equilibrium (e.g., dissolving and crystallization in a saturated salt solution).

### **Sub-Unit 8.4: Le Châtelier's Principle & Predicting Shifts**

**Le Châtelier's Principle** states: If a stress is applied to a a system at equilibrium, the system will shift in a way that relieves or counteracts the stress. A "shift" means the rate of either the forward or reverse reaction temporarily increases until a new equilibrium is established.

**Common Stresses and Shifts:**

Consider the reversible reaction: N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) \+ heat (Exothermic forward)

* **Change in Concentration:**  
  * **Add a substance:** The equilibrium will shift **away** from the added substance.  
    * If we add N₂, the system will shift **right** to use up the extra N₂ and produce more NH₃.  
  * **Remove a substance:** The equilibrium will shift **toward** the removed substance to replace it.  
    * If we remove NH₃, the system will shift **right** to produce more NH₃.  
* **Change in Pressure (for gases only):**  
  * **Increase pressure:** The equilibrium will shift toward the side with **fewer moles of gas**.  
    * In the example, the left has 4 moles of gas (1+3) and the right has 2 moles. Increasing pressure will cause a shift to the **right**.  
  * **Decrease pressure:** The equilibrium will shift toward the side with **more moles of gas**.  
    * Decreasing pressure will cause a shift to the **left**.  
* **Change in Temperature:**  
  * **Increase temperature (add heat):** The equilibrium will shift in the **endothermic** direction to absorb the added heat.  
    * In the example, the forward reaction is exothermic, so the reverse is endothermic. Adding heat will cause a shift to the **left**.  
  * **Decrease temperature (remove heat):** The equilibrium will shift in the **exothermic** direction to replace the lost heat.  
    * Removing heat will cause a shift to the **right**.  
* **Adding a Catalyst:**  
  * A catalyst speeds up **both** the forward and reverse reactions equally. It helps the system reach equilibrium **faster**, but it does **not** cause a shift in the equilibrium position.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 8.1:** A "Collision Theory Simulator." Students can control the temperature and concentration of reactant particles in a box. They can observe how these changes affect the frequency and energy of collisions, with a counter tracking the number of "effective collisions" per second.  
* **For 8.2:** An "Interactive PE Diagram." Students can drag a slider to add or remove a catalyst, which would dynamically lower or raise the activation energy hill on the diagram. They could also change the PE of the products to see how the diagram changes for an endothermic vs. exothermic reaction.  
* **For 8.4:** A "Le Châtelier's Equilibrium Lab." Students are presented with a virtual, closed system (like the N₂/H₂/NH₃ example). They can use sliders to change the concentration of any substance, the pressure, or the temperature, and watch the molecular concentrations adjust in real-time as the system shifts to a new equilibrium.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Increasing the temperature of a chemical reaction increases the reaction rate primarily because it:  
   (A) increases the concentration of the reactants.  
   (B) increases the frequency and energy of particle collisions.  
   (C) lowers the activation energy of the reaction.  
   (D) lowers the heat of reaction (ΔH).  
   (Answer: B)  
2. Given the system at equilibrium: 2SO₂(g) \+ O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g) \+ heat. Which change will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right?  
   (A) Adding a catalyst.  
   (B) Increasing the temperature.  
   (C) Increasing the concentration of SO₃.  
   (D) Increasing the pressure.  
   (Answer: D)

Short Answer:  
3\. On a potential energy diagram, what is the effect of adding a catalyst on the activation energy and the heat of reaction (ΔH)?  
(Answer: Adding a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway. It has no effect on the heat of reaction (ΔH) because the potential energy of the reactants and products remains unchanged.)

4. Define chemical equilibrium. Why is it referred to as a "dynamic" equilibrium?  
   (Answer: Chemical equilibrium is the state where the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. It is called "dynamic" because both the forward and reverse reactions are still occurring, but there is no net change in the concentrations of the substances involved.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Consider the equilibrium: H₂(g) \+ I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g). State the effect that each of the following changes will have on the concentration of HI.  
(a) Addition of H₂ gas.  
(b) Removal of I₂ gas.  
(c) Increasing the pressure.  
(Answer:  
(a) Increases the concentration of HI (shifts right).  
(b) Decreases the concentration of HI (shifts left).  
(c) No effect. (There are 2 moles of gas on the left and 2 moles of gas on the right, so pressure has no effect on the equilibrium position).)  
Application:  
6\. Food is often stored in a refrigerator to prevent it from spoiling. Using your knowledge of kinetics, explain why refrigeration is an effective method of food preservation.  
(Answer: Spoiling is caused by chemical reactions (often carried out by bacteria). A refrigerator lowers the temperature. According to kinetics, decreasing the temperature decreases the kinetic energy of particles, which slows down the rate of chemical reactions. By slowing down the spoilage reactions, a refrigerator keeps food fresh for longer.)  
Extension:  
7\. The industrial production of ammonia via the Haber process (N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) \+ heat) is a crucial equilibrium reaction. To maximize the yield of ammonia (NH₃), would you recommend using high or low temperatures, and high or low pressures? Explain your reasoning for each.  
(Answer:  
Pressure: You would use high pressure. The product side has fewer moles of gas (2 moles) than the reactant side (4 moles). According to Le Châtelier's principle, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the production of more ammonia.  
Temperature: From a purely equilibrium standpoint, you would use low temperature. The forward reaction is exothermic. Decreasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the right to produce more heat, thus favoring the production of more ammonia. (In reality, the industrial process uses a compromise temperature that is high enough for a reasonable reaction rate but low enough for a favorable equilibrium position).)

#### **Real-World Connections**

**Kinetics** and **equilibrium** govern countless processes around us. The **catalytic converter** in a car uses catalysts (like platinum and rhodium) to speed up the conversion of toxic exhaust gases into safer substances. **Enzymes** in our bodies are biological catalysts that allow the complex chemical reactions of life to occur at body temperature. **Le Châtelier's Principle** explains how our bodies transport oxygen: hemoglobin in the blood binds to oxygen in the lungs (high O₂ concentration, shifts right) and releases it in the tissues (low O₂ concentration, shifts left). It also explains how carbonated drinks go flat when opened—the pressure is released, and the equilibrium CO₂(aq) ⇌ CO₂(g) shifts to the right, causing the gas to escape.

### **Go Deeper: The Equilibrium Constant (Keq)**

While Le Châtelier's Principle tells us the *direction* an equilibrium will shift, the **equilibrium constant (Keq)** gives us a mathematical way to describe the position of equilibrium. Keq is a ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium.

For a general reversible reaction: aA \+ bB ⇌ cC \+ dD

The equilibrium constant expression is written as:  
Keq \= (\[C\]ᶜ\[D\]ᵈ) / (\[A\]ᵃ\[B\]ᵇ)

* \[ \] denotes the molar concentration of the substance at equilibrium.  
* The coefficients from the balanced equation become the exponents in the expression.  
* **Important:** Only substances in the **gaseous (g)** and **aqueous (aq)** states are included in the Keq expression. Pure solids (s) and pure liquids (l) have constant concentrations and are omitted.

**Interpreting the Value of Keq:**

* **If Keq \> 1:** The concentration of products is greater than the concentration of reactants at equilibrium. The equilibrium "lies to the right," and **products are favored**.  
* **If Keq \< 1:** The concentration of reactants is greater than the concentration of products at equilibrium. The equilibrium "lies to the left," and **reactants are favored**.  
* **If Keq ≈ 1:** The concentrations of reactants and products are roughly equal at equilibrium.

Example Calculation:  
For the reaction N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g), at a certain temperature, the equilibrium concentrations are found to be:

* \[N₂\] \= 0.50 M  
* \[H₂\] \= 1.20 M  
* \[NH₃\] \= 0.80 M  
1. Write the Keq expression:  
   Keq \= \[NH₃\]² / (\[N₂\]\[H₂\]³)  
2. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations and solve:  
   Keq \= (0.80)² / ((0.50)(1.20)³) \= 0.64 / (0.50 \* 1.728) \= 0.64 / 0.864  
   Keq ≈ 0.74

Since Keq is less than 1, this indicates that at this specific temperature, the equilibrium favors the reactants (N₂ and H₂).
