### **Unit 12: Nuclear Chemistry**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

In our final unit, we shift our focus from electron-driven chemical reactions to the immense power held within the nucleus of the atom. **Nuclear chemistry** is the study of reactions that involve changes in the nucleus, releasing amounts of energy far greater than any chemical reaction. We will begin by exploring **radioactivity**, the process by which unstable nuclei spontaneously decay, emitting particles like alpha and beta particles, or energy in the form of gamma rays. You'll learn to write and balance nuclear equations, which track the changes in protons and neutrons during these transformations. A key concept we will master is **half-life**, the predictable rate at which radioactive isotopes decay, a principle that allows us to date ancient artifacts and design medical treatments. Finally, we will compare and contrast **fission**, the splitting of heavy nuclei used in nuclear power plants, and **fusion**, the joining of light nuclei that powers the sun and stars, and discuss the profound uses and inherent risks of harnessing nuclear energy.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Define natural radioactivity and identify the properties of alpha, beta, and gamma emissions.  
* Write and balance nuclear equations for various types of decay.  
* Define half-life and perform calculations to determine the amount of a radioactive isotope remaining after a period of time.  
* Compare and contrast nuclear fission and nuclear fusion reactions.  
* Describe some of the beneficial uses and associated risks of radioisotopes and nuclear reactions.

### **Sub-Unit 12.1: Natural Radioactivity & Types of Decay**

Some atomic nuclei are inherently unstable, often because they have an imbalanced ratio of neutrons to protons. These unstable nuclei undergo **radioactive decay**, spontaneously emitting radiation to become more stable.

There are three main types of natural radiation:

| Radiation Type | Symbol(s) | Composition | Charge | Mass (amu) | Penetrating Power |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Alpha Particle** | α, ⁴₂He | Helium nucleus (2 p⁺, 2 n⁰) | \+2 | 4 | Low (stopped by paper) |
| **Beta Particle** | β⁻, ⁰₋₁e | Electron | \-1 | \~0 | Medium (stopped by foil) |
| **Gamma Ray** | γ | High-energy photon | 0 | 0 | High (stopped by lead) |

Other important decay types include:

* **Positron Emission (β⁺):** A proton in the nucleus becomes a neutron and a **positron** (⁰₁e, an "anti-electron" with a \+1 charge) is emitted.  
* **Electron Capture:** An inner-shell electron is captured by the nucleus, combining with a proton to form a neutron.

### **Sub-Unit 12.2: Balancing Nuclear Equations**

A **nuclear equation** represents a change in the nucleus. When balancing nuclear equations, two rules must be followed:

1. **Conservation of Mass Number:** The sum of the mass numbers (superscripts) on the left side of the equation must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the right side.  
2. **Conservation of Atomic Number (Charge):** The sum of the atomic numbers (subscripts) on the left side must equal the sum of the atomic numbers on the right side.

**Examples:**

* Alpha Decay of Uranium-238:  
  ²³⁸₉₂U → ⁴₂He \+ ²³⁴₉₀Th  
  * Mass numbers: 238 \= 4 \+ 234  
  * Atomic numbers: 92 \= 2 \+ 90  
* Beta Decay of Carbon-14:  
  ¹⁴₆C → ⁰₋₁e \+ ¹⁴₇N  
  * Mass numbers: 14 \= 0 \+ 14  
  * Atomic numbers: 6 \= \-1 \+ 7

### **Sub-Unit 12.3: Half-Life & Half-Life Calculations**

Radioactive decay is a random process for a single atom, but for a large sample, the rate of decay is predictable. The **half-life (t₁/₂)** is the time required for **one-half** of the nuclei in a radioactive sample to decay.

Half-life is constant and is not affected by temperature, pressure, or chemical conditions. It can range from fractions of a second to billions of years.

Calculating Remaining Amount:  
After each half-life passes, the amount of the original radioactive substance is reduced by half.

* After 1 half-life: 1/2 remains  
* After 2 half-lives: 1/4 remains  
* After 3 half-lives: 1/8 remains  
* And so on...

**Example:** The half-life of Iodine-131 is 8 days. If you start with a 40 g sample, how much will be left after 24 days?

1. Determine the number of half-lives: Number of half-lives \= Total time / Half-life \= 24 days / 8 days \= 3 half-lives.  
2. Calculate the remaining amount:  
   * Start: 40 g  
   * After 1st half-life (8 days): 20 g  
   * After 2nd half-life (16 days): 10 g  
   * After 3rd half-life (24 days): **5 g**

### **Sub-Unit 12.4: Fission vs. Fusion**

**Artificial transmutation** is the process of changing one element into another by bombarding a nucleus with high-energy particles (like protons or neutrons). Fission and fusion are two very important types of transmutation that release enormous amounts of energy. This energy comes from the conversion of a tiny amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E \= mc².

* **Nuclear Fission:** The process in which a **heavy nucleus** (like Uranium-235) is **split** into two or more smaller, lighter nuclei when struck by a neutron. This process releases a huge amount of energy and several more neutrons, which can go on to split other nuclei, creating a **chain reaction**.  
  * **Application:** Nuclear power plants and atomic bombs.  
* **Nuclear Fusion:** The process in which two or more **light nuclei** (like hydrogen isotopes) **combine** at extremely high temperatures and pressures to form a heavier, more stable nucleus.  
  * **Application:** Powers the sun and other stars. Hydrogen bombs.  
  * Fusion releases even **more energy** per gram of fuel than fission and produces less long-lived radioactive waste. However, achieving the necessary conditions for controlled fusion on Earth is a major technological challenge.

### **Sub-Unit 12.5: Uses & Risks of Radioisotopes**

Radioisotopes have many beneficial applications in medicine, research, and industry, but their use also comes with risks.

**Beneficial Uses:**

* **Medicine:**  
  * **Diagnosis:** Tracers like Technetium-99m can be injected into the body to create images of organs and track bodily processes.  
  * **Treatment:** High-energy radiation from Cobalt-60 or Cesium-137 can be targeted at tumors to destroy cancer cells. Iodine-131 is used to treat thyroid disorders.  
* **Radioactive Dating:** The predictable decay of Carbon-14 (for organic remains) and Uranium-238 (for rocks) allows scientists to determine the age of ancient objects.  
* **Industrial Applications:** Radiation can be used to sterilize medical equipment and preserve food by killing bacteria.

**Risks:**

* **Biological Damage:** Radiation can damage or destroy living cells, leading to illness, genetic mutations, and cancer.  
* **Long-Term Waste Disposal:** The radioactive waste from nuclear power plants remains dangerous for thousands of years, and finding safe, permanent storage solutions is a major environmental and political challenge.  
* **Accidents:** Accidents at nuclear power plants (like Chernobyl or Fukushima) can release large amounts of radioactive material into the environment.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 12.2:** A "Nuclear Decay Equation Balancer." A user is shown an incomplete nuclear equation (e.g., ²²⁶₈₈Ra → ? \+ ⁴₂He). They must determine the mass number, atomic number, and symbol of the missing nuclide to balance the equation.  
* **For 12.3:** A "Half-Life Simulation." Students start with a sample of 100 virtual radioactive atoms. They can set the half-life and press a "start" button. The simulation would show atoms decaying over time, with a graph plotting the number of remaining parent atoms vs. time, clearly illustrating the half-life concept.  
* **For 12.4:** A "Fission vs. Fusion Sorter." Students are shown descriptions or diagrams of nuclear processes (e.g., "A U-235 nucleus is struck by a neutron and splits," "Two hydrogen nuclei combine in the sun's core") and must drag them into the correct category bin, "Fission" or "Fusion."

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Which type of radiation is most similar to a helium nucleus?  
   (A) Alpha particle  
   (B) Beta particle  
   (C) Gamma ray  
   (D) Positron  
   (Answer: A)  
2. Given the nuclear reaction: ¹⁴₆C → ¹⁴₇N \+ X. What is particle X?  
   (A) An alpha particle  
   (B) A beta particle  
   (C) A positron  
   (D) A neutron  
   (Answer: B. To conserve charge, X must have a subscript of \-1. This is a beta particle.)

Short Answer:  
3\. A sample of a radioisotope has a half-life of 10 years. What fraction of the original sample will remain after 30 years?  
(Answer: 30 years is equal to 3 half-lives (30/10 \= 3). After 3 half-lives, the fraction remaining is (1/2)³ \= 1/8.)

4. State one major advantage of fusion over fission as a source of energy.  
   (Answer: Fusion produces significantly more energy per gram of fuel, its fuel source (hydrogen isotopes) is abundant, and it produces less long-lived radioactive waste.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Complete the following nuclear equation: ²³⁵₉₂U \+ ¹₀n → ¹⁴¹₅₆Ba \+ ? \+ 3¹₀n  
(Answer:  
To balance mass number: 235 \+ 1 \= 141 \+ x \+ 3(1) → 236 \= 144 \+ x → x \= 92\.  
To balance atomic number: 92 \+ 0 \= 56 \+ y \+ 3(0) → 92 \= 56 \+ y → y \= 36\.  
The missing nuclide has mass number 92 and atomic number 36\. Element 36 is Krypton (Kr). The missing particle is ⁹²₃₆Kr.)  
Application:  
6\. An ancient wooden artifact is found to have a Carbon-14 concentration that is one-fourth (1/4) of that found in living trees. If the half-life of Carbon-14 is 5730 years, what is the approximate age of the artifact?  
(Answer: For 1/4 of the sample to remain, two half-lives must have passed (1/2 → 1/4). The age of the artifact is 2 × 5730 years \= 11,460 years.)  
Extension:  
7\. A patient is given a medical treatment with a radioisotope that has a half-life of 12 hours. Explain why an isotope with a very long half-life (e.g., thousands of years) would be unsuitable and potentially dangerous for this type of medical application.  
(Answer: An isotope with a long half-life would remain radioactive inside the patient's body for a very long time. This would lead to prolonged exposure to radiation, significantly increasing the risk of cellular damage and cancer. Medical isotopes need to have a short half-life so that they decay to a stable, non-radioactive form quickly after they have served their diagnostic or therapeutic purpose, minimizing the radiation dose to the patient.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Nuclear chemistry has a powerful and complex impact on our world. It is the source of energy in **nuclear power plants** that provide electricity to millions. In medicine, **radioisotopes** are essential tools for both diagnosing diseases through imaging (PET scans) and treating them (radiotherapy). **Carbon dating** has revolutionized archaeology and paleontology, allowing us to accurately determine the age of fossils and artifacts. The destructive power of nuclear reactions is harnessed in **nuclear weapons**, while the constructive power of fusion is the long-term hope for a clean and virtually limitless energy source. The smoke detectors in our homes often use a tiny amount of a radioisotope (Americium-241) to function, making nuclear principles a part of our daily safety.

### **Go Deeper: The Band of Stability & Decay Prediction**

Why are some isotopes radioactive while others are stable? The answer lies in the **neutron-to-proton (n/p) ratio** within the nucleus. The **Band of Stability** is a graph that plots the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for all known stable nuclides. This graph reveals a clear pattern for nuclear stability.

* For **light elements** (up to about Z=20), the stable n/p ratio is very close to **1:1**.  
* For **heavier elements**, the stable n/p ratio gradually increases to about **1.5:1**. This is because more neutrons are needed to provide enough strong nuclear force to overcome the increasing electrostatic repulsion between the many positive protons.

By comparing an isotope's position to the Band of Stability, we can predict its likely mode of decay:

* **Nuclides Above the Band:** These isotopes have **too many neutrons** (a high n/p ratio). To become more stable, they need to convert a neutron into a proton. They achieve this through **beta (β⁻) decay**. This process decreases the number of neutrons by one and increases the number of protons by one, lowering the n/p ratio and moving the nuclide closer to the band.  
  * Example: ¹⁴₆C (n/p \= 8/6 ≈ 1.33) undergoes beta decay to form ¹⁴₇N (n/p \= 7/7 \= 1), which is stable.  
* **Nuclides Below the Band:** These isotopes have **too many protons** (a low n/p ratio). To become stable, they must convert a proton into a neutron. They can do this through two main processes: **positron (β⁺) emission** or **electron capture**. Both processes increase the number of neutrons by one and decrease the number of protons by one, increasing the n/p ratio and moving the nuclide closer to the band.  
  * Example: ¹¹₆C (n/p \= 5/6 ≈ 0.83) undergoes positron emission to form ¹¹₅B (n/p \= 6/5 \= 1.2), which is stable.  
* **Heavy Nuclides (Z \> 83):** All nuclides with more than 83 protons are too heavy to be stable, regardless of their n/p ratio. The repulsive forces between protons are simply too great. These elements undergo **alpha (α) decay** to reduce both their mass and charge, shedding two protons and two neutrons in a single step. This often begins a long decay chain that continues until a stable, lighter nuclide (often an isotope of lead) is formed.
