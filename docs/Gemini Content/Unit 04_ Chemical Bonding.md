### **Unit 04: Chemical Bonding**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit explores one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry: how and why atoms join together to form the substances that make up our world. We will investigate the driving force behind chemical bonding—the quest for atomic stability, often fulfilled by achieving the electron configuration of a noble gas (the "octet rule"). You will learn to distinguish between the three main types of chemical bonds: ionic bonds, formed by the transfer of electrons; covalent bonds, formed by the sharing of electrons; and metallic bonds, a unique sea of shared electrons. A major focus will be learning to draw Lewis dot structures to visualize valence electrons and predict how atoms will bond. We'll delve into the concept of polarity, determining whether bonds and entire molecules have an uneven distribution of charge. Finally, we will explore the weaker, but critically important, intermolecular forces that exist *between* molecules, which explain properties like why water is a liquid at room temperature while oxygen is a gas.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Explain why atoms form chemical bonds in terms of stability and the octet rule.  
* Differentiate between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.  
* Predict the type of bond that will form between two atoms using their positions on the periodic table and electronegativity differences.  
* Draw Lewis dot structures for atoms, ions, and simple covalent molecules.  
* Determine the polarity of a bond and the overall polarity of a molecule based on its shape.  
* Describe the properties of ionic, molecular (covalent), and metallic substances and relate them to their bonding.  
* Identify and compare the strengths of intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, and London dispersion forces).

### **Sub-Unit 4.1: The Nature of Chemical Bonds & The Octet Rule**

Atoms form chemical bonds to become more stable. For most atoms, stability means achieving a full valence electron shell, like the noble gases in Group 18\. This tendency is called the **octet rule**, which states that atoms will gain, lose, or share electrons in order to acquire a full set of eight valence electrons. (Hydrogen is a key exception; it aims for a "duet" of two electrons, like helium).

When atoms bond, they lower their overall potential energy, resulting in a more stable arrangement. The type of bond that forms depends on how the atoms' valence electrons are rearranged.

### **Sub-Unit 4.2: Ionic Bonding: Electron Transfer & Properties**

An **ionic bond** is formed by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. This typically occurs between a **metal** and a **nonmetal**.

* **Formation:** The metal atom, which has low ionization energy and low electronegativity, **transfers** one or more of its valence electrons to the nonmetal atom, which has high electronegativity.  
  * The metal atom becomes a positive ion (**cation**).  
  * The nonmetal atom becomes a negative ion (**anion**).  
* **Example: NaCl:** A sodium atom (Na, 2-8-1) readily gives its 1 valence electron to a chlorine atom (Cl, 2-8-7).  
  * Na becomes Na⁺ (2-8), a stable cation.  
  * Cl becomes Cl⁻ (2-8-8), a stable anion.  
  * The strong attraction between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ forms the ionic bond.

**Properties of Ionic Compounds:**

* Form hard, brittle crystalline solids (crystal lattice structure).  
* Have very high melting and boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces.  
* Are poor conductors of electricity in the solid state because ions are locked in place.  
* Are good conductors of electricity when melted (molten) or dissolved in water (**aqueous**) because the ions are free to move and carry charge.  
* Many are soluble in water.

### **Sub-Unit 4.3: Covalent Bonding: Electron Sharing & Lewis Dot Structures**

A **covalent bond** is formed when two **nonmetal** atoms **share** one or more pairs of valence electrons. By sharing, both atoms can achieve a stable octet. The shared pair of electrons effectively belongs to both atoms. A group of atoms joined by covalent bonds is called a **molecule**.

* **Single Bond:** One pair of electrons is shared (e.g., in H₂ or Cl₂).  
* **Double Bond:** Two pairs of electrons are shared (e.g., in O₂).  
* **Triple Bond:** Three pairs of electrons are shared (e.g., in N₂).

**Lewis dot structures** are diagrams that show the valence electrons as dots around an element's symbol. They are essential for visualizing how covalent bonds form.

**Drawing Lewis Structures (Simple):**

1. Sum the valence electrons for all atoms in the molecule.  
2. Arrange the atoms, placing the least electronegative atom in the center.  
3. Connect atoms with single bonds (a line represents 2 electrons).  
4. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs to satisfy the octet rule for the outer atoms first, then the central atom.  
5. If the central atom doesn't have an octet, move a lone pair from an outer atom to form a double or triple bond.

**Example: Water (H₂O)**

* Valence electrons: 1 (from H) \+ 1 (from H) \+ 6 (from O) \= 8  
* Structure: H–O–H. This uses 4 electrons.  
* Remaining electrons: 8 \- 4 \= 4\. Place these as two lone pairs on the central oxygen atom.  
* Result: Oxygen has an octet (2 bonds \+ 2 lone pairs), and each hydrogen has a duet.

### **Sub-Unit 4.4: Molecular Polarity: Bond Polarity & Molecular Shape (VSEPR)**

Bond Polarity:  
Not all covalent bonds involve equal sharing. The difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) between two atoms determines the bond's polarity.

* **Nonpolar Covalent Bond (ΔEN \< 0.4):** Electrons are shared equally. Occurs between identical atoms (e.g., H–H, Cl–Cl) or atoms with very similar electronegativity.  
* **Polar Covalent Bond (ΔEN 0.4 \- 1.7):** Electrons are shared unequally. The more electronegative atom pulls the bonding electrons closer, gaining a partial negative charge (δ⁻), while the less electronegative atom gains a partial positive charge (δ⁺). Example: in H–Cl, chlorine is more electronegative, so the bond is polar.

Molecular Polarity:  
A molecule's overall polarity depends on both the polarity of its bonds and its molecular shape.

* **VSEPR Theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion):** This theory states that electron pairs (both bonding and lone pairs) around a central atom will arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion. This determines the molecule's shape.  
* **Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical:**  
  * If a molecule has polar bonds but is **symmetrical** in shape, the bond polarities cancel each other out, and the molecule is **nonpolar**. Example: CO₂ is linear (O=C=O). The C=O bonds are polar, but their effects cancel, making the molecule nonpolar.  
  * If a molecule has polar bonds and is **asymmetrical** in shape, the bond polarities do not cancel, resulting in an overall **polar molecule** (or dipole). Example: H₂O is bent. The polar H–O bonds and the asymmetrical shape make the entire water molecule polar.

### **Sub-Unit 4.5: Metallic Bonding & Properties of Metals**

**Metallic bonding** is found in solid metals. It consists of positively charged metal cations arranged in a fixed lattice, surrounded by a "sea" of mobile, delocalized valence electrons. These electrons are not tied to any single atom and are free to move throughout the entire metal.

This unique structure explains the properties of metals:

* **Good Electrical Conductivity:** The mobile electrons are free to flow and carry an electric current.  
* **Good Thermal Conductivity:** The mobile electrons can transfer kinetic energy (heat) quickly.  
* **Malleable and Ductile:** When the metal is struck, the cations can slide past one another within the electron sea without breaking the bonds.  
* **Lustrous (Shiny):** The mobile electrons absorb and re-emit light energy.

### **Sub-Unit 4.6: Intermolecular Forces (IMFs) & Their Effects**

**Intermolecular forces (IMFs)** are the weak attractive forces *between* molecules. They are much weaker than the ionic, covalent, or metallic bonds *within* a substance, but they are crucial for determining a substance's physical properties, like its melting and boiling point.

* **London Dispersion Forces (LDFs):** The weakest IMF, present in **all** molecules. Caused by the random motion of electrons creating temporary, instantaneous dipoles. LDFs are stronger for larger molecules with more electrons.  
* **Dipole-Dipole Forces:** The attractive force between the positive end of one polar molecule and the negative end of another polar molecule. Stronger than LDFs.  
* **Hydrogen Bonding:** A special, extra-strong type of dipole-dipole force. It occurs only in molecules where hydrogen is directly bonded to a small, highly electronegative atom: **Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), or Fluorine (F)**. Water (H₂O) is the classic example. Hydrogen bonds are the strongest type of IMF.

**Effect on Properties:** The stronger the intermolecular forces, the more energy is required to pull the molecules apart. Therefore, stronger IMFs lead to **higher melting points and boiling points**.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 4.2 & 4.3:** A "Bonding Simulator." Students select two elements from a mini periodic table. The simulator animates what happens: for a metal and nonmetal, it shows the electron transfer to form ions; for two nonmetals, it shows them coming together to share electrons.  
* **For 4.4:** An interactive "Molecule Polarity Lab." Students build molecules (like H₂O, CO₂, NH₃, CH₄) in a 3D space. They can toggle on/off bond polarity vectors and a molecular dipole arrow to see how shape (symmetrical vs. asymmetrical) affects overall polarity.  
* **For 4.6:** A "Boiling Point Challenge." Students are shown pairs of molecules (e.g., H₂O vs. H₂S; CH₄ vs. C₄H₁₀) and must predict which one has the higher boiling point. They then get feedback explaining the dominant IMF and why it leads to that result.

   (Answer: D)

Short Answer:  
3\. Draw the Lewis dot structure for a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂).  
(Answer: O=C=O, with two lone pairs of electrons on each oxygen atom. The structure should show two double bonds between the carbon and each oxygen.)

4. Explain why metals are excellent conductors of electricity.  
   (Answer: Metals have a "sea" of mobile, delocalized valence electrons that are not bound to any single atom. These electrons are free to move throughout the metal structure and can carry an electric current.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Based on electronegativity differences, classify the bond in each of the following compounds as ionic, polar covalent, or nonpolar covalent:  
(a) K-Cl (EN: K=0.8, Cl=3.2)  
(b) O-H (EN: O=3.4, H=2.2)  
(c) N-N (EN: N=3.0)  
(Answer:  
(a) ΔEN \= 3.2 \- 0.8 \= 2.4. This large difference indicates an ionic bond.  
(b) ΔEN \= 3.4 \- 2.2 \= 1.2. This indicates a polar covalent bond.  
(c) ΔEN \= 3.0 \- 3.0 \= 0\. This indicates a nonpolar covalent bond.)  
Application:  
6\. Water (H₂O) and methane (CH₄) have similar molar masses. However, water is a liquid at room temperature while methane is a gas. Explain this difference in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: Water is a polar molecule capable of strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. Methane is a nonpolar molecule and only has weak London dispersion forces between its molecules. The strong hydrogen bonds in water require much more energy to overcome, resulting in a much higher boiling point, making it a liquid at room temperature.)  
Extension:  
7\. Graphite and diamond are both allotropes (different forms) of pure carbon. Diamond is extremely hard and an electrical insulator, while graphite is soft, slippery, and an electrical conductor. Explain these different properties in terms of their bonding structures.  
(Answer: In diamond, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a strong, rigid, three-dimensional tetrahedral network. This makes it extremely hard, and the electrons are locked in bonds, so it doesn't conduct electricity. In graphite, carbon atoms are bonded in flat, two-dimensional hexagonal sheets. The bonds within the sheets are strong, but the sheets are held together by weak intermolecular forces, allowing them to slide past each other, making graphite soft and slippery. Graphite also has delocalized electrons within the sheets that are free to move, allowing it to conduct electricity.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Chemical bonding is the reason materials have the properties they do. **Ionic bonding** explains why table salt is a brittle crystal that dissolves in water to conduct electricity. **Covalent bonding** is the basis of life, holding together the molecules of DNA, proteins, and sugars. The polarity of water, a result of its covalent bonds and shape, makes it the "universal solvent" essential for all living organisms. **Metallic bonding** is why we can have electrical wires, sturdy building materials, and jewelry. And **intermolecular forces** explain everyday phenomena, like why ice floats (hydrogen bonding creates an open crystal structure) and how geckos can stick to walls (using van der Waals forces, a type of IMF).

### **Go Deeper: VSEPR and Hybrid Orbital Theory**

While the basic shapes (linear, bent, tetrahedral, pyramidal) cover many molecules, VSEPR theory can predict more complex geometries for atoms that don't follow the octet rule. This often happens with central atoms from Period 3 and below.

* **Expanded Octets:**  
  * **5 Electron Domains (e.g., PCl₅):** The electron pairs arrange themselves in a **trigonal bipyramidal** geometry to maximize distance. The bond angles are 90° and 120°.  
  * **6 Electron Domains (e.g., SF₆):** The electron pairs arrange in an **octahedral** geometry. All bond angles are 90°.

Hybrid Orbital Theory:  
How can carbon, with electrons in one s and three p orbitals, form four identical single bonds in a perfect tetrahedron like methane (CH₄)? The answer is hybridization. This theory proposes that atomic orbitals on a central atom can mix to form a new set of identical hybrid orbitals.

* **sp³ Hybridization:** One *s* orbital and three *p* orbitals mix to form **four** identical **sp³ hybrid orbitals**. These orbitals point towards the corners of a **tetrahedron** (109.5° angle). This is the hybridization found in molecules like methane (CH₄) and ammonia (NH₃). Each sp³ orbital forms a single (sigma) bond.  
* **sp² Hybridization:** One *s* orbital and two *p* orbitals mix to form **three** identical **sp² hybrid orbitals**. These orbitals lie in a plane, pointing to the corners of a **trigone** (120° angle). The remaining unhybridized *p* orbital is perpendicular to this plane and is used to form the second bond in a double bond (a pi bond). This is found in molecules like ethene (C₂H₄).  
* **sp Hybridization:** One *s* orbital and one *p* orbital mix to form **two** identical **sp hybrid orbitals**. These point in opposite directions, creating a **linear** geometry (180° angle). The two remaining unhybridized *p* orbitals are used to form the two pi bonds in a triple bond. This is found in molecules like ethyne (C₂H₂).

Hybridization provides a more advanced explanation for how atoms use their atomic orbitals to create the molecular geometries that VSEPR theory predicts.
