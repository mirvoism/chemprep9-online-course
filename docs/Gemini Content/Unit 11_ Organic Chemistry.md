### **Unit 11: Organic Chemistry**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit provides an introduction to the vast and fascinating world of **organic chemistry**—the chemistry of carbon compounds. You will discover what makes carbon so special, allowing it to form the backbone of millions of different molecules, including those essential for life. We will start with the simplest organic molecules, the **hydrocarbons**, and learn how to name and classify them into families like alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. We will then expand our view to include various **functional groups**, which are specific arrangements of atoms that give molecules their characteristic properties and reactivity. You'll learn to identify these groups, such as alcohols, organic acids, and esters. We will also explore the concept of **isomers**, molecules that share the same chemical formula but have different structures and properties. Finally, you'll be introduced to the main types of organic reactions, such as substitution, addition, and polymerization, which are used to build the complex molecules that make up everything from plastics to proteins.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Describe the unique bonding characteristics of the carbon atom.  
* Name and draw structures for simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes).  
* Identify and name common functional groups.  
* Define and identify isomers.  
* Classify common organic reactions, including substitution, addition, polymerization, fermentation, esterification, and saponification.

### **Sub-Unit 11.1: Properties of Carbon & Hydrocarbons**

**Organic chemistry** is the study of carbon-containing compounds. Carbon is unique because:

1. It has four valence electrons, allowing it to form **four strong covalent bonds**.  
2. It can bond with a wide variety of other elements.  
3. It can bond with other carbon atoms to form long chains, branched chains, and rings.

**Hydrocarbons** are the simplest organic compounds, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are the primary components of fossil fuels. We classify them into homologous series based on the type of bonds between carbon atoms.

* **Alkanes:** Contain only **single** carbon-carbon bonds. They are considered **saturated** because they hold the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms. Their names end in **\-ane**.  
  * General Formula: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂  
  * Examples: Methane (CH₄), Ethane (C₂H₆), Propane (C₃H₈)  
* **Alkenes:** Contain at least one **double** carbon-carbon bond. They are **unsaturated** because they could hold more hydrogen atoms if the double bond were broken. Their names end in **\-ene**.  
  * General Formula: CₙH₂ₙ (for one double bond)  
  * Examples: Ethene (C₂H₄), Propene (C₃H₆)  
* **Alkynes:** Contain at least one **triple** carbon-carbon bond. They are also **unsaturated**. Their names end in **\-yne**.  
  * General Formula: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂ (for one triple bond)  
  * Examples: Ethyne (C₂H₂), Propyne (C₃H₄)

### **Sub-Unit 11.2: Functional Groups**

A **functional group** is a specific atom or group of atoms within a larger molecule that gives the molecule its characteristic chemical properties and reactivity. The rest of the molecule is often represented by 'R'. (See Table R in the NYS Reference Tables).

| Class of Compound | Functional Group | General Formula | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Halide** (Halocarbon) | \-F, \-Cl, \-Br, \-I | R-X | CH₃Cl (Chloromethane) |
| **Alcohol** | \-OH (hydroxyl) | R-OH | CH₃OH (Methanol) |
| **Ether** | \-O- | R-O-R' | CH₃OCH₃ (Dimethyl ether) |
| **Aldehyde** | \-CHO | R-CHO | HCHO (Methanal) |
| **Ketone** | \-CO- | R-CO-R' | CH₃COCH₃ (Propanone) |
| **Organic Acid** | \-COOH (carboxyl) | R-COOH | CH₃COOH (Ethanoic acid) |
| **Ester** | \-COO- | R-COO-R' | CH₃COOCH₃ (Methyl ethanoate) |
| **Amine** | \-NH₂ | R-NH₂ | CH₃NH₂ (Methanamine) |

### **Sub-Unit 11.3: Isomers**

**Isomers** are compounds that have the **same molecular formula** but **different structural formulas** and, therefore, different properties.

For example, the molecular formula C₄H₁₀ can represent two different isomers:

1. Butane: A straight chain of four carbon atoms.  
   CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃  
2. 2-methylpropane (isobutane): A branched chain.  
   CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃

These two molecules have the same number of C and H atoms, but their atoms are connected differently, giving them different boiling points, melting points, and reactivity. As the number of carbon atoms increases, the number of possible isomers grows rapidly.

### **Sub-Unit 11.4: Types of Organic Reactions**

* **Substitution:** An atom or group of atoms is replaced by another atom or group. This is characteristic of **saturated** compounds (alkanes).  
  * Example: CH₄ \+ Cl₂ → CH₃Cl \+ HCl  
* **Addition:** An atom or group of atoms is added to an **unsaturated** molecule by breaking a double or triple bond.  
  * Example: C₂H₄ \+ Cl₂ → C₂H₄Cl₂  
* **Combustion:** An organic compound burns in the presence of oxygen to produce CO₂ and H₂O. (This is also a redox reaction).  
  * Example: C₃H₈ \+ 5O₂ → 3CO₂ \+ 4H₂O  
* **Esterification:** An organic acid reacts with an alcohol to produce an ester and water. Esters are known for their pleasant, fruity smells.  
  * Organic Acid \+ Alcohol ⇌ Ester \+ Water  
* **Fermentation:** A process, often carried out by yeast, that breaks down sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide.  
  * C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) → 2C₂H₅OH (ethanol) \+ 2CO₂  
* **Saponification:** The reaction between a fat (which is a large ester) and a strong base (like NaOH) to produce soap and glycerol. This is essentially the hydrolysis of an ester.  
* **Polymerization:** A process in which many small molecules, called **monomers**, are joined together to form a very large molecule, called a **polymer**.  
  * Example: Many ethene monomers join to form polyethylene, a common plastic.

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 11.1 & 11.2:** A "Molecule Builder." Students can drag and drop carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and various functional groups from a palette to build and rotate molecules in 3D. The tool would automatically name the resulting compound based on IUPAC rules.  
* **For 11.3:** an "Isomer Hunt" game. The game provides a molecular formula (e.g., C₅H₁₂) and challenges the student to draw all the possible structural isomers. The system would validate each structure they draw.  
* **For 11.4:** a "Reaction Mechanism Animator." Students select a reaction type (e.g., addition) and two reactants. The tool animates the process at the molecular level, showing bonds breaking and forming as the reaction proceeds to products.

#### **Assessment Questions**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. Which compound is a member of the alkene series?  
   (A) C₂H₂  
   (B) C₃H₆  
   (C) C₄H₁₀  
   (D) C₅H₁₂  
   (Answer: B. Alkenes follow the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.)  
2. The functional group \-COOH is characteristic of an:  
   (A) ester  
   (B) alcohol  
   (C) organic acid  
   (D) aldehyde  
   (Answer: C)

Short Answer:  
3\. Draw the structural formula for 2-pentene.  
(Answer: A five-carbon chain with a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃)

4. Explain the difference between a substitution reaction and an addition reaction.  
   (Answer: A substitution reaction involves replacing an atom on a saturated molecule, resulting in two products. An addition reaction involves adding atoms to an unsaturated molecule by breaking a double or triple bond, resulting in only one product.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. What is the IUPAC name of the compound with the following structural formula: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃? What class of organic compound is it?  
(Answer: The name is 2-butanol. It is an alcohol.)  
Application:  
6\. The pleasant aroma of pineapple is due to the ester ethyl butanoate. This ester is formed from the reaction of an alcohol and an organic acid. Identify the specific alcohol and specific organic acid needed to produce ethyl butanoate.  
(Answer: The "ethyl" part of the name comes from the alcohol, ethanol. The "butanoate" part comes from the organic acid, butanoic acid.)  
Extension:  
7\. The compounds diethyl ether (CH₃CH₂OCH₂CH₃) and 1-butanol (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH) are isomers with the formula C₄H₁₀O. Predict which compound has a significantly higher boiling point and explain your choice in terms of intermolecular forces.  
(Answer: 1-butanol will have a much higher boiling point. Although they have the same molar mass, 1-butanol is an alcohol and has a polar \-OH group, which allows it to form strong hydrogen bonds between its molecules. Diethyl ether is an ether; it is slightly polar but cannot form hydrogen bonds with itself. The strong hydrogen bonds in 1-butanol require much more energy to overcome than the weaker dipole-dipole and dispersion forces in diethyl ether.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Organic chemistry is the chemistry of life and modern materials. The molecules of life—**DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats**—are all organic compounds. **Fossil fuels** (hydrocarbons) power our world. **Polymers** make up the plastics, fabrics (like nylon and polyester), and materials we use every day. The sweet smells of fruits and perfumes often come from **esters**. The effectiveness of medicines is determined by the specific structure and functional groups of their organic molecules. **Fermentation** is used to make everything from bread to biofuels. In short, it is impossible to go through a day without encountering and using dozens of products made possible by organic chemistry.

### **Go Deeper: Stereoisomerism & Spectroscopy**

Structural isomers have different connectivity, but there's a more subtle type of isomerism that is crucial in biology and medicine.

**Stereoisomers** have the same molecular formula and the same atom-to-atom connectivity, but they differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space.

* **Chirality:** A key concept in stereoisomerism is **chirality** (from the Greek word for "hand"). A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable, just like your left and right hands are mirror images but cannot be perfectly overlapped. This usually occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four *different* groups. Such a carbon is called a **chiral center**.  
* **Enantiomers:** A pair of non-superimposable mirror-image molecules are called **enantiomers**. They have identical physical properties (boiling point, density, etc.) except for one: they rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.  
  * **Example:** The amino acid alanine has two enantiomers. The "L-form" is the one used by our bodies to build proteins, while the "D-form" is not. Many drugs are chiral, and often only one enantiomer provides the therapeutic effect while the other may be inactive or even harmful. The tragic case of thalidomide in the 1950s, where one enantiomer was a sedative and the other caused birth defects, highlights the critical importance of stereochemistry.

An Introduction to Spectroscopy:  
How do chemists know the structure of a molecule they've synthesized? They use spectroscopy, which involves studying the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation.

* **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** When molecules are exposed to infrared radiation, their bonds stretch and bend at specific frequencies. An IR spectrum is a plot showing which frequencies of IR light are absorbed by the molecule. Since different functional groups (O-H, C=O, C-H) absorb at characteristic frequencies, an IR spectrum can be used to identify which functional groups are present in a molecule. For example, a strong, broad peak around 3300 cm⁻¹ is a tell-tale sign of an alcohol's O-H group.  
* **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:** NMR is one of the most powerful tools for determining the exact carbon-hydrogen framework of a molecule. It involves placing a sample in a strong magnetic field and hitting it with radio waves. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) in different chemical environments absorb energy at slightly different frequencies. An NMR spectrum provides detailed information about:  
  1. The number of different types of protons in the molecule.  
  2. The number of protons of each type.  
  3. The number of neighboring protons for each type.

By analyzing the data from IR and NMR together, chemists can piece together the complete structure of an unknown organic compound like solving a complex puzzle.
