### **Unit 05: Chemical Reactions & Stoichiometry**

#### **Overview & Learning Objectives**

This unit is the heart of quantitative chemistry, where we learn the "recipes" of chemical reactions. We will begin by learning how to translate chemical changes into a universal language: balanced chemical equations. You'll master the art of balancing these equations to uphold the fundamental Law of Conservation of Mass and learn to classify reactions into several key types. The centerpiece of this unit is the introduction of a chemist's most essential quantity: the **mole**. You will come to understand the mole as a specific number of particles and use it as a bridge to connect the microscopic world of atoms and molecules to the macroscopic world of grams that we can measure in the lab. Using the mole, you'll learn how to calculate a compound's formula, determine its percent composition, and—most importantly—use the ratios in balanced equations to predict the amounts of reactants consumed and products formed in a reaction. This quantitative relationship is called **stoichiometry**, the essential tool for any chemist.

**Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:**

* Write and balance chemical equations, upholding the Law of Conservation of Mass.  
* Identify and classify reactions as synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, or combustion.  
* Define the mole in terms of Avogadro's number and use it in conversions between mass, moles, and particles.  
* Calculate the molar mass, percent composition, empirical formula, and molecular formula of a compound.  
* Use stoichiometry (mole ratios from balanced equations) to perform mole-to-mole and mass-to-mass calculations.  
* Conceptually understand limiting reactants and calculate percent yield.

### **Sub-Unit 5.1: Writing & Balancing Chemical Equations**

A **chemical equation** is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. It shows the starting materials, called **reactants**, on the left side, and the new substances formed, called **products**, on the right side. An arrow (→) separates the reactants from the products and means "yields" or "produces."

**Law of Conservation of Mass:** This fundamental law states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. At the atomic level, this means the number of atoms of each element must be identical on both sides of the equation.

To uphold this law, we must **balance** the equation by placing whole-number **coefficients** in front of the chemical formulas. **Important:** Never change the subscripts in a chemical formula, as that would change the identity of the substance itself\!

**Example: The reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water.**

1. **Word Equation:** Hydrogen \+ Oxygen → Water  
2. **Formula Equation (Unbalanced):** H₂ \+ O₂ → H₂O  
3. **Balancing:**  
   * Left side: 2 H, 2 O  
   * Right side: 2 H, 1 O  
   * The oxygen atoms are not balanced. Place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O to balance the oxygen: H₂ \+ O₂ → **2**H₂O  
   * Now: Left has 2 O, Right has 2 O. But now the hydrogen is unbalanced (Left has 2 H, Right has 4 H).  
   * Place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂ to balance the hydrogen: **2**H₂ \+ O₂ → 2H₂O  
4. **Final Check:** Left: 4 H, 2 O. Right: 4 H, 2 O. The equation is now balanced.

### **Sub-Unit 5.2: Types of Chemical Reactions**

We can classify most chemical reactions into a few general categories:

* **Synthesis (or Combination):** Two or more simple substances combine to form a single, more complex product.  
  * General Form: A \+ B → AB  
  * Example: 2Mg(s) \+ O₂(g) → 2MgO(s)  
* **Decomposition:** A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.  
  * General Form: AB → A \+ B  
  * Example: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) \+ O₂(g)  
* **Single Replacement (or Displacement):** One element replaces a similar element in a compound.  
  * General Form: A \+ BC → AC \+ B  
  * Example: Zn(s) \+ 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) \+ H₂(g) (Zinc replaces hydrogen)  
* **Double Replacement (or Metathesis):** The ions of two ionic compounds exchange places in a solution to form two new compounds. These reactions often form a **precipitate** (an insoluble solid), a gas, or water.  
  * General Form: AB \+ CD → AD \+ CB  
  * Example: AgNO₃(aq) \+ NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) \+ NaNO₃(aq) (AgCl is a precipitate)  
* **Combustion:** A substance (usually a hydrocarbon) reacts rapidly with oxygen gas (O₂), releasing energy in the form of heat and light. The products of complete combustion of a hydrocarbon are always carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O).  
  * Example: CH₄(g) \+ 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) \+ 2H₂O(g)

### **Sub-Unit 5.3: The Mole Concept & Avogadro's Number**

Atoms and molecules are incredibly small, so we can't count them individually. Instead, chemists use a unit called the **mole** (abbreviated **mol**). The mole is a specific quantity, just like a "dozen" means 12\.

* **1 mole \= 6.022 × 10²³ representative particles.**

This massive number is called **Avogadro's number**. The "representative particle" can be atoms, molecules, or formula units, depending on the substance.

* For an element like iron (Fe), 1 mole \= 6.022 × 10²³ **atoms**.  
* For a covalent compound like water (H₂O), 1 mole \= 6.022 × 10²³ **molecules**.  
* For an ionic compound like salt (NaCl), 1 mole \= 6.022 × 10²³ **formula units**.

### **Sub-Unit 5.4: Molar Mass & Percent Composition**

The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass, in grams, of one mole of that substance. Its units are grams per mole (g/mol). Conveniently, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equal to its formula mass in atomic mass units (amu).

* **To find molar mass:** Add up the atomic masses of all the atoms in the chemical formula (using the masses from the periodic table).  
* **Example: Water (H₂O)**  
  * H: 2 × 1.01 g/mol \= 2.02 g/mol  
  * O: 1 × 16.00 g/mol \= 16.00 g/mol  
  * Molar Mass of H₂O \= 2.02 \+ 16.00 \= **18.02 g/mol**

The mole (and molar mass) is the crucial bridge that connects the mass of a substance (which we can measure on a balance) to the number of particles it contains.

Percent Composition is the percentage by mass of each element in a compound.  
% by mass of element \= (mass of element in 1 mole / molar mass of compound) × 100%

### **Sub-Unit 5.5: Empirical & Molecular Formulas**

* **Empirical Formula:** The simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound.  
* **Molecular Formula:** The actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule of the compound.

The molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. For example, the sugar glucose has a molecular formula of C₆H₁₂O₆. Its empirical formula is the simplest ratio, which is CH₂O.

**To find the empirical formula from percent composition:**

1. Assume a 100 g sample (so percentages become grams).  
2. Convert the mass of each element to moles using its molar mass.  
3. Divide all mole values by the smallest mole value to find the simplest ratio.  
4. If the ratios are not whole numbers, multiply by a common factor to get whole numbers.

### **Sub-Unit 5.6: Stoichiometry (Mole-Mole, Mass-Mass)**

**Stoichiometry** is the study of the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. The coefficients in a balanced equation give us the **mole ratio**, which is the key to all stoichiometric calculations.

The balanced equation 2H₂ \+ O₂ → 2H₂O can be read as:  
"2 moles of H₂ react with 1 mole of O₂ to produce 2 moles of H₂O."  
Mass-to-Mass Calculation Steps:  
This is the most common type of stoichiometry problem.

1. **Start with a balanced chemical equation.**  
2. Convert the given mass of a substance to **moles** using its molar mass.  
3. Use the **mole ratio** from the balanced equation to convert moles of the given substance to moles of the unknown substance.  
4. Convert the moles of the unknown substance to **mass** using its molar mass.

**Example:** In the reaction 2H₂ \+ O₂ → 2H₂O, how many grams of H₂O are produced from 4.0 g of H₂?

1. Balanced equation is given.  
2. Convert grams H₂ to moles H₂: 4.0 g H₂ × (1 mol H₂ / 2.02 g H₂) \= 1.98 mol H₂  
3. Use mole ratio (2 mol H₂ : 2 mol H₂O, or 1:1) to find moles H₂O: 1.98 mol H₂ × (2 mol H₂O / 2 mol H₂) \= 1.98 mol H₂O  
4. Convert moles H₂O to grams H₂O: 1.98 mol H₂O × (18.02 g H₂O / 1 mol H₂O) \= 35.7 g H₂O

### **Sub-Unit 5.7: Limiting Reactants & Percent Yield**

* **Limiting Reactant:** In a reaction, you often don't have the exact stoichiometric amounts of reactants. The **limiting reactant** is the reactant that gets completely used up first, thus limiting the amount of product that can be formed. The other reactant is called the **excess reactant**.  
* **Theoretical Yield:** The maximum amount of product that *could* be formed from the given amounts of reactants, as calculated using stoichiometry.  
* **Actual Yield:** The amount of product that is *actually* obtained when the reaction is performed in the lab. It is almost always less than the theoretical yield.  
* Percent Yield: A measure of the efficiency of a reaction.  
  Percent Yield \= (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100%

#### **Interactive Element Suggestions**

* **For 5.1:** A "Chemical Equation Balancer." The user enters an unbalanced equation, and the tool provides hints or guides them through balancing atom by atom. It could have multiple difficulty levels.  
* **For 5.2:** A "Reaction Type Sorter" game. Students are shown various balanced equations and must drag them into the correct category bin (Synthesis, Decomposition, etc.).  
* **For 5.6:** An interactive "Stoichiometry Calculator." The user selects a balanced reaction, inputs a mass for one substance, and the tool walks them step-by-step through the calculation (g → mol → mol → g) to find the mass of another substance, highlighting the mole ratio step.

(Answer: Molar mass of CO₂ \= 12.01 \+ 2(16.00) \= 44.01 g/mol. Mass \= 2.50 mol × 44.01 g/mol \= 110\. g)

4. A compound has an empirical formula of CH₂ and a molar mass of 56 g/mol. What is its molecular formula?  
   (Answer: Mass of empirical formula (CH₂) \= 12.01 \+ 2(1.01) \= 14.03 g/mol. Multiplier \= (Molar Mass / Empirical Mass) \= 56 / 14.03 ≈ 4\. The molecular formula is 4 × (CH₂) \= C₄H₈.)

Problem Solving:  
5\. Given the reaction: N₂(g) \+ 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g). If 5.0 grams of N₂ react completely with excess H₂, how many grams of NH₃ will be produced?  
(Answer:  
Moles N₂ \= 5.0 g / 28.02 g/mol \= 0.178 mol N₂.  
Moles NH₃ \= 0.178 mol N₂ × (2 mol NH₃ / 1 mol N₂) \= 0.356 mol NH₃.  
Mass NH₃ \= 0.356 mol NH₃ × 17.04 g/mol \= 6.1 g NH₃.)  
Application:

(Answer: Percent Yield \= (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100% \= (5.85 g / 6.31 g) × 100% \= 92.7%)  
Extension:  
7\. The reaction for making aspirin is: C₇H₆O₃ \+ C₄H₆O₃ → C₉H₈O₄ \+ HC₂H₃O₂. If a chemist starts with 14.0 grams of C₇H₆O₃ (salicylic acid, M=138.12 g/mol) and 20.0 grams of C₄H₆O₃ (acetic anhydride, M=102.09 g/mol), which one is the limiting reactant?  
(Answer: Moles C₇H₆O₃ \= 14.0g / 138.12g/mol \= 0.101 mol. Moles C₄H₆O₃ \= 20.0g / 102.09g/mol \= 0.196 mol. The reaction is a 1:1 ratio. Since there are fewer moles of salicylic acid (0.101 mol) than acetic anhydride (0.196 mol), the salicylic acid (C₇H₆O₃) is the limiting reactant.)

#### **Real-World Connections**

Stoichiometry is used everywhere. **Pharmaceutical companies** use it to determine the correct amounts of reactants needed to produce a specific dose of medicine. **Engineers** use it to calculate how much fuel a rocket will need to reach orbit. **Food scientists** use it to determine the recipes for products and to calculate nutritional information. The concept of a **limiting reactant** is familiar to anyone who has ever run out of one ingredient while baking cookies—you can only make as many cookies as your limiting ingredient (like eggs or flour) allows. And **percent yield** is critical in manufacturing; a high percent yield means an efficient, cost-effective process, while a low yield signals a problem that needs to be fixed.

### **Go Deeper: Solution Stoichiometry**

Stoichiometry isn't limited to reactions with pure solids or gases. Many reactions happen in aqueous solutions, where we measure amounts using volume and concentration (molarity). **Solution stoichiometry** integrates the principles of stoichiometry with the concept of molarity.

The key connection is that molarity can be used as a conversion factor to find the moles of a reactant or product in a solution.  
moles \= Molarity × Volume (in Liters)  
Typical Problem: How many milliliters of 0.500 M HCl solution are needed to completely react with 10.0 g of zinc according to the reaction:  
Zn(s) \+ 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) \+ H₂(g)  
**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Find moles of the given substance (Zn).**  
   * Molar mass of Zn \= 65.38 g/mol  
   * moles Zn \= 10.0 g Zn × (1 mol Zn / 65.38 g Zn) \= 0.153 mol Zn  
2. **Use the mole ratio to find moles of the unknown substance (HCl).**  
   * From the balanced equation, the ratio is 1 mol Zn : 2 mol HCl.  
   * moles HCl \= 0.153 mol Zn × (2 mol HCl / 1 mol Zn) \= 0.306 mol HCl  
3. **Use the molarity of the unknown solution to find its volume.**  
   * Rearrange the molarity formula: Volume \= moles / Molarity  
   * Volume HCl \= 0.306 mol HCl / 0.500 mol/L \= 0.612 L  
4. **Convert to the desired unit (mL).**  
   * 0.612 L × (1000 mL / 1 L) \= 612 mL

This process combines mass-based stoichiometry with solution-based calculations and is fundamental to lab techniques like **titration**, where the volume of one solution is carefully measured to determine the concentration of another. For titrations involving **polyprotic acids** (acids that can donate more than one proton, like H₂SO₄) or polyhydroxy bases (like Ca(OH)₂), you must be extra careful to use the correct mole ratio from the balanced neutralization reaction.
