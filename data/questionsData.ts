    question: "Which sample is a pure substance?",
    choiceA: "air",
    choiceB: "brass",
    choiceC: "water (H₂O)",
    choiceD: "sea water",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "Water (H₂O) is a compound with a fixed composition (two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom), making it a pure substance. Air, brass (an alloy), and sea water are mixtures because their compositions can vary and they consist of multiple substances not chemically bonded in fixed ratios."

    choiceB: "chemical change",
    choiceC: "phase change",
    choiceD: "nuclear change",

    choiceC: "sand and water",
    choiceD: "air",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "Sand and water is a heterogeneous mixture because the sand does not dissolve uniformly in the water; its composition is not uniform throughout, and the components (sand and water) can be visually distinguished and easily separated by physical means like decantation or filtration."

    choiceC: "5",
    choiceD: "6",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "Rules for significant figures: Non-zero digits (2,5,6) are significant. Zeros between non-zero digits (the first 0 in 06) are significant. Leading zeros (0.0) are not significant. Trailing zeros after a decimal point and after a non-zero digit (the last 0) are significant. Thus, 2, 5, 0, 6, 0 are significant, giving 5 significant figures."

    choiceC: "atomic nucleus",
    choiceD: "electron energy levels",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "In Rutherford's gold foil experiment, the unexpected scattering of alpha particles (some at large angles, a few even bouncing back) led him to conclude that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus where most of the atom's mass is concentrated. The majority of alpha particles passing straight through indicated that the atom is mostly empty space."

    choiceA: "6",
    choiceB: "8",
    choiceC: "14",
    choiceD: "20",
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons. The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons. Therefore, Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number = 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons."

    choiceA: "Ionic bond",
    choiceB: "Covalent bond",
    choiceC: "Metallic bond",
    choiceD: "Hydrogen bond",
    answer: "A",
    explanation: "An ionic bond is formed when one or more electrons are transferred from a metal atom (which becomes a positive ion, or cation) to a nonmetal atom (which becomes a negative ion, or anion). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond."

    choiceB: "Double covalent bond",
    choiceC: "Triple covalent bond",
    choiceD: "Single covalent bond",

    choiceB: "18.02 g/mol",
    choiceC: "16.00 g/mol",
    choiceD: "2.02 g/mol",
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "The molar mass of H₂O is calculated as: (2 * atomic mass of H) + (1 * atomic mass of O) = (2 * 1.01 g/mol) + (1 * 16.00 g/mol) = 2.02 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 18.02 g/mol."

    choiceB: "1.00 mol",
    choiceC: "2.00 mol",
    choiceD: "44.0 mol",
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "Moles = Mass / Molar mass. Moles of CO₂ = 44.0 g / 44.01 g/mol ≈ 1.00 mol. (Rounding to appropriate sig figs based on input, it's very close to 1.00)."

    choiceA: "double",
    choiceB: "be halved",
    choiceC: "remain the same",
    choiceD: "quadruple",
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "Boyle's Law states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional (P₁V₁ = P₂V₂). If pressure is doubled (P₂ = 2P₁), then V₂ = P₁V₁ / (2P₁) = V₁/2, so the volume will be halved."

    choiceA: "strongly acidic",
    choiceB: "weakly acidic",
    choiceC: "neutral",
    choiceD: "weakly basic",
    answer: "A",
    explanation: "The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 is acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. A pH of 3 is significantly less than 7, indicating a strongly acidic solution."

    choiceA: "6.2 cm",
    choiceB: "6.20 cm",
    choiceC: "6.200 cm",
    choiceD: "6 cm",
    answer: "A",
    explanation: "2.5 cm (2 sig figs) * 3.10 cm (3 sig figs) = 7.75 cm². Then 7.75 cm² / 1.25 cm (3 sig figs). The overall operation is limited by the least number of sig figs in any original measurement, which is 2 sig figs from 2.5 cm. (2.5 * 3.10) / 1.25 = 7.75 / 1.25 = 6.2. So, the answer is 6.2 cm."

    choiceB: "protons, electrons",
    choiceC: "protons, neutrons",
    choiceD: "electrons, neutrons",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "Isotopes are atoms of the same element, meaning they have the same atomic number (number of protons). They differ in their mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons."

    choiceA: "H₂O",
    choiceB: "NaCl",
    choiceC: "N₂",
    choiceD: "HCl",
    answer: "C",
    explanation: "N₂ consists of two nitrogen atoms, which have identical electronegativities. Therefore, the electrons are shared equally, forming a nonpolar covalent bond. H₂O and HCl have polar covalent bonds due to electronegativity differences. NaCl is ionically bonded."

    choiceC: "1.204 x 10²⁴ atoms",
    choiceD: "0.50 atoms",
    answer: "B",

    choiceA: "2.0 L",
    choiceB: "5.3 L",
    choiceC: "8.0 L",
    choiceD: "3.0 L",
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "Using Charles's Law (V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂). Convert temperatures to Kelvin: T₁ = 27+273 = 300 K; T₂ = 127+273 = 400 K. V₁ = 4.0 L. So, (4.0 L / 300 K) = (V₂ / 400 K). V₂ = (4.0 L * 400 K) / 300 K = 1600/300 L = 5.33 L. Rounded to two significant figures, V₂ = 5.3 L."

    choiceC: "Zn²⁺(aq)",
    choiceD: "Cu(s)",
    answer: "A",
    explanation: "Oxidation is the loss of electrons, resulting in an increase in oxidation state. Zinc (Zn) goes from an oxidation state of 0 in Zn(s) to +2 in Zn²⁺(aq), so it loses electrons and is oxidized."
